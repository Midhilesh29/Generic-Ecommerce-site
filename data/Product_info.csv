 on 24 Aug. 2010 // The interactive Chuggington is a brilliant idea. However I was left a little dissapointed. I was under the impression each chugger interacted with each other automatically. This is not so, you have to continually press the horn of each chugger and then they will interact and comment on what is around them i.e tunnell, chugwash etc....This is ok for older children who have grasped the idea and know what to do. But for younger children it reverts to a push along train and in effect is no different from the die-cast edition. I know as my child gets older he will develop his play but I feel a little mis-led by the concept. I have also had to return the action chugger as the paint on the wings was peeling. I have asked for a replacement however as action chugger is the main man in our household! Enjoy! | Wheels to the rails! // 4.0 // 22 April 2011 // By

 on 22 April 2011 // My 3 year old son loves his talking trains - they are in his top 3 toys. We initially bought him Koko and Wilson for Christmas but could not find a Brewster to go with them, so promised him one for his birthday, then we got him the Brewster with track and tunnel set. I have to say he gets more pleasure from the trains than the tracks, which are rather fiddly to set up (grown-ups have to do this) and he doesn't seem to have grasped that you have to raise the drawbridge with the little lever - if you raise it by hand, it tends to lift off the tracks so I'm constantly having to help him put it back. He also keeps switching the tunnel off for some reason. However, the toys are very sturdy, the trains in particular have been subjected to a certain amount of bashing but have withstood all ill treatment (I do take them away if he gets too boisterous).The trains are beautifully made - bright, sturdy, cheerful and just like their TV counterparts, with nice clear voices which are also individually distinctive. They prompt imaginative, interactive play - he talks to them and makes up stories for them, and we have to stop him taking them to bed with him otherwise he would stay up all night chatting! There seems to be quite a wide range of comments between the trains, although disappointingly, only a couple of responses to the tunnel and drawbridge. The trains respond over quite a large distance, for example he has left one on the stairs and you could hear it joining in while he played with the others in the living room, so I would say at least within hearing range. Of course now he wants the Chugwash (he saw it on the side of the box) so further sets & trains will have to be added in future...Read more › | My son loves this // 5.0 // 28 Dec. 2010 // By

 on 28 Dec. 2010 // I bought this for my 3 year old son for christmas and he hasn't stopped playing with it, for a last minute purchase it has turned out to be the best.  He loves it so much i've just bought the straigh& curved track and the extra level track to make it even more enjoyable... what i love most about this is that you can buy so many things to add on, so for easter i'll get him more for the track so he'll never get bored.I along with the othe person's review thought the trains would automatically interact with each other but my son is getting used to pressing the buttons more now so it's not so bad, i think for a younger child they wouldn't get as much fun from the interactive part.On the whole I would definately recommend this product... have fun chugging everyone xxx | What an excellent toy // 5.0 // 23 April 2014 // By

 on 23 April 2014 // I bought this (with an extra Wilson loco) for my very bright two year old grandson over 18 months ago.  It has easily been his all-time favourite toy and he always wants to play with it when he visits.  The larger size of the locos are just the right size for him to play with by himself and and the interactive noises keep him interested for ages.  The track must have been set out and taken up over 100 hundred times now, but everything still works perfectly with absolutely no broken parts (which I find amazing). | This a really good point and we're just got what we wanted // 5.0 // 6 Nov. 2014 // By

I only have 2 interactive trains, they say a few things to each other but not a lot. You would need everthing for it to say as much as it can!

Most times it seems to be a different phrase but I can imagine the kids having loads of fun as I believe they will interact with the track itsself as well.Got them on special offer with Amazon, would work out fairly expensive paying full price for them all but for a fiver each, SUPER!!! | Foreign koko // 1.0 // 3 Jan. 2012 // By

 on 18 April 2012 // I bought this for my 3 year old son who is obsessed with Thomas and the Trackmaster collection. He absolutly loves the day of the diesels film, so I got him this train, along with Den, Dart and Bell. Its still great fun like all previous trackmaster trains, and is fantastic for any child who loves playing with trains. I think its great for developing imaginative play too, as he now makes the ""diesels"" and ""steamies"" role play and talk, and we've painted an old box to make a diesel works. He absolutly loves diesel 10 and takes him everywhere. The only criticism I would have is that he requires a C cell battery, which I have to replace every 2-3 days, but this is probably because my son literally plays with him from the moment he gets up to the time he goes to bed! | Not fit for purpose! // 1.0 // 29 Dec. 2012 // By

The battery does not stay in place.  Any jolt or movement dislodges the battery which has only the metal connections to each end holding it in a large space.  We tried packing it with card but in the end playdough all round the battery filling the cavity held it in place so he could play with it.It is so disappointing for children when new toys don't work.

Luckily he already has a couple of sets as this 'playset' is just a train.It does say what is included in the details to be fair, but I still think the product name is misleading.I can't fault the train though, other than the claw arm being fixed in place.

 on 24 Nov. 2013 // Although the review title is positive I do have to start off with a small compliant. Although the package arrived and appeared to be well protected for some reason the front 4 wheels/bogey area was not connected up to the rest of the train and it took a while to figure out how to fix it on properly!That said, I think this is most likely an unlucky one off. The train set is good value for money (especially when compared to the crazy prices for the DCC already installed trains!), the locomotive and carriages appear to be of a very good standard and it runs excellently so far. No regrets in buying this at all!EDIT - I now have to add another negative point... though it has a happy ending. After a day or so the locomotive stuttered and stopped. It had occurred to me while it was running that it sounded a little rough compared to what it should sound like but the stoppage was quite sudden... though it did get going again it was stuttering still. If you come across this apply some small amounts of machine oil to the areas mentioned in the maintenance guide that comes with this train set and then try and running it for a few minutes and it should return to normal! | LNER'S Flying Scotsman. // 4.0 // 3 Nov. 2012 // By

 on 3 Nov. 2012 // This is one of the most popular trains in the world and Hornby has produced a very good model which looks like the real machine.Before I purchased this train set, I did some research and found that there are several versions of the Flying Scotsman train set.The versions are:-1) Flying Scotsman train set which includes two coaches, oval and track pack A.2) Flying Scotsman train set which includes three coaches, oval and track pack A.3) Flying Scotsman train set which includes three coaches, oval with track pack A and B.As I already have the Eurostar train set with Track packs A,B,C and D I decided to buy No.2. I have used most of the track to integrate it with my existing train set, and will extend it later when I buy some more points. That way I don't have any room for Track Packs E and F.The detail to the engine and the tender are very good and when it runs you can see the connecting rods moving. The three coaches are of good detail, you can see into the windows, each coach has 1st and 3rd class compartments (2nd class disappeard sometime ago) and both the corridor and seats are clearly visible.Putting the train on the track took a little time and care is needed when coupling it to the coal tender and the rest of the train.I found that the Flying Scotsman does require a very flat surface to run one, and time needs to be spent getting all the creases out the base mat.As this train set is at a cost, I would not let young children play with it on their own, but under adult supervision they should be able to enjoy this train set.Read more › | Mostly a great set; but not a toy; and ruined by one fundamental design flaw // 1.0 // 24 Nov. 2013 // By

 on 24 Nov. 2013 // Especially as discounted by Amazon, this is a good price for what is mostly an attractive and well made train set. I'd classify it as a younger-modeller or beginner's set in that the detailing isn't as fine as Hornby's more expensive models, or of some of the others in the market, e.g. Bachmann.The track is pretty good quality, but does need laying carefully on a hard and properly flat surface - I certainly wouldn't use the trackmat on the floor. Train sets like this really need a level of preparation and investment in a solid baseboard, and without one you'll run into problems like some of the other reviewers.The real problem I have is that the coupling on the rear of the tender that connects it to the carriages is ridiculously flimsy; it's held in place by a tiny thread of unsupported soft plastic; after about ten light uses of the set it's already nearly snapped off and can no longer support its own weight.I purchased this as a project to build with my young son and with memories of the Hornby set I had as a boy. It's really disappointing to find that it's many good qualities are ruined by a small but crucial element that renders it quickly useless. | Better than expected // 5.0 // 26 Dec. 2012 // By

 on 26 Dec. 2012 // Despite some negative reviews regarding the quality of the layout mat, we decided to take a chance and get this as a Christmas present for our 12-year old son. Surprisingly, the mat turned out to be made of vinyl and not paper as described (I guess that Hornby listens to its customers!). This on top of the high quality track, carriages and engine, it made the perfect gift. A little forward planning helped as we had a sheet of thin board ready to ensure a smooth surface for trouble-free track set-up. The bottom line is that our son is thrilled with the set and is currently shopping for track expansion sets to spend his Amazon gift vouchers on! | Boyhood dream fulfilled - after fifty years!

 on 26 May 2009 // This game is great - my daughter got it for her 5th birthday and we have played with it since, and she is now nearly 8. The best thing is it is simple and down to the roll of a dice - it helps with counting and learning to take turns. As skill doesn't really come into it, children don't feel disheartened if adults seem to strike ahead as the turn of the dice usually evens things up at the end.

HALL OF FAMETOP 500 REVIEWER on 21 Sept. 2009 // There's not too much you can write about Dice, but these are of a good size and feel solid and balanced in your hand and when you throw them. They are in the traditional black on white, or white on black style and come in 30 to a pack which makes them very good value for money. These will be perfect for any specific dice games, as well as replacing lost dice from any board games you may have. They could also be used as an inexpensive way of teaching kids about numbers and probability in schools. Great value for money.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page. | Dice // 4.0 // 23 April 2009 // By

They are an equal mix of black and white dice which I used for making up packs of 3 (of one colour) dice with a paper of meanings/instructions for telling fortunes with them. this is a non commercial venture I do it for fun, and when I gave them to friends they had a ball playing with them. The Dice are perfect size for this project, easily thrown onto tabletop and the spots are well defined. What more can I say? Very happy with product.

Surface is slightly carved/pressed/moulded (cannot say which one of these) so it add depth to the paint job.  Now the best bit!!! I assume as courtensy and as advertisement I recieved 1 carved (3d) 6 side dice where each side represent one of patterns they produce. That what I call treating your customers well. Just to mention one of the 3d dices is currently sold for £20 (one pattern all over) so I consider this as lovely touch as you can actually see how lovely thos paterns look like.On delivery side I was stunned!!!!

TOP 1000 REVIEWER on 31 Jan. 2016 // Overview: These are a set of cubes which show a different image on each face. The aim of these are for the children to roll them and put them in order to make a sequence ready for a story. The child is then to use their imagination to create a story based on those characters, props and themes.Score includes images of: whistle, horse, timer, target, trophy, tennis ball, sports shirt etcUses: These are a fantastic resource to use in the classroom or at home. They come in a variety of styles which will suit different topics and children's interests. In the classroom they can be used individually with children or they could be used as a whole group with each child having a different image to add to the whole class story (e.g. sit in a circle and try to add a sequence to the running story). At home, or in the car journey they can be used to keep children amused and stimulated throughout.They are:> Compact, lightweight and durable.> Come in a lovely presentation box to keep them safe!> Have a different image on each face e.g a character, prop or themes/ideas.> Have a variety of themes to choose from e.g. other imagination ones and a new batman one has just been released.Would highly recommend to anyone who has children or works with them! They are fab!!!! Many hours of enjoymentActivity ideas:> Could be used to help develop EAL learners language recall. This may include rolling a dice and the children in the small EAL group need to say the key word as quick as possible. The first child to say it wins a point.> As a whole class each child could roll and dice and then one by one go around the room with each child adding an element to the story.Read more › | Great idea, and excellent stocking filler // 4.0 // 28 Dec. 2015 // By

 on 22 Nov. 2012 // The dice are fairly standard and are good quality. Only comments I can make on them is that the 4 sided die is a number at top d4, rather than number at base. Not that this really matters. The other point is I would think the ideal set would dice of the same type in different colours so you can roll them simultaneously and have them mean different things eg with both d10 being the same colour it makes rolling them as 10s and 1s to generate 1-100 numbers problematic. However I knew that from the picture just suggesting a differnt ideal mix of the same dice. Also it would be nice to have 2 d6s for completeness. | It's dice how can they go wrong // 5.0 // 17 Jan. 2010 // By

I mixed the 2 packets of before thinking so I don't have anyway to compare them against each other sadly.My main complaint is with the dice with blank number ink (white and yellow dice), the numbers generally just look rather shoddy, some of them are okay but a lot of have missing ink, too thick ink or ink just going off of the number. Some of the numbers on the other colour dice don't exactly look amazing either but most are pretty good.Overall you get what you pay for and for the price, I'm happy with them.

If you gonna buy little neat bag like this from any UK distributor it will cost you AT LEAST £10. Therefore I am more than satisfied with this as it fulfil my expectation and maybe even exceed them.On delivery side I was stunned!!!! P&P cost £2.90 Item arrived in 3 days! FROM POLAND!!!

My only surprise, and it was a pleasant one was that it is larger than I expected and it has a satisfying weightiness to it. The engraved patterns are sharp and the 'inking' of the lines is solid with no gaps or 'blurry' bits. I had occasion to correspond with the company and found their customer support excellent.

Mexican Wrestling Dice is a two-player dice game (with optional rules for four-player tag-team play) based on the popular world of professional Mexican wrestling, or ""Lucha Libre"" (a.k.a. free fighting). Players start with 21 points of health (or 18 in a tag-team match) and roll custom dice to try to either reduce the opponent's strength points to zero to win by a knock-out (KO) or hold the opponent down on the mat for a ""count of three"" to win by a pin. The player sitting near the 'red' corner of the wrestling ring uses 4 'red' wrestling dice, the player near the 'blue' corner, the 4 blue wrestling dice. Each player also has a HIT die and a PIN die. Players begin by each rolling their own set of 'wrestling dice' at the same time, trying to ensure that they land in, or touching the wrestling ring. The results of HITs, BLOCKs, COUNTERs, and MISS rolled are played off against each other then the HIT dice can be rolled to see what damage they did. i.e Drop Kick, Forearm smash, Table slam etc. Damage is recorded on the Strength Score Card of the player being hit. If a player rolls two HITs in one round, instead of rolling the HIT dice twice, they can take a chance on the Luchador! die once which may result in their wrestler's trademark moves and inflict much more damage on their opponent. Any PINs rolled in a round may be re-rolled, once only. However once an opponent is reduced on their strength to where they are pinable, the PIN die is held until after the HITs have been inflicted then the PIN die is rolled. If PIN comes up, the 'three count' begins. The player being pinned has three attempts to save, using their wrestling dice or lose the match. In a tag-team match players have the choice of trying to tag-out to regain slight strength, but it can also cost them..., if they fail to tag and get dragged back into the ring by their eager opponent.","Technical Details Item Weight399 g Product Dimensions13 x 13 x 4.2 cm Manufacturer recommended age:8 years and up Item model numberBSG 1301 Assembly RequiredYes    Additional Information ASINB00ELT2B26 Best Sellers Rank 344,119 in Toys & Games (See top 100) #997 in Toys & Games > Games > Dice & Dice Games Shipping Weight921 g Delivery Destinations:Visit the Delivery Destinations Help page to see where this item can be delivered.

 on 22 Mar. 2014 // Luchador! Mexican Wrestling Dice is a fantastic game. The rules are very easy to learn and the gameplay is really fun. the random element of rolling the dice to attack is balanced with the dexterity element of attempting to slyly nudge your opponents dice from the board when you roll. The tactical element of knowing when to go for a pin, when to save a dice to block with and when to go for a high risk move makes the game complete. Luchador! is a great casual dice roller that gets it right on so many levels. recommended for almost any game collection. | Reviewing the components for Luchador // 5.0 // 24 Sept. 2014 // By

Also, the dice are very large (or should I say huge!) and it's hard to hold more than two in one hand and are not as smooth as casino dice should be. In short, nothing like Casino Quality dice. In addition, I was two dice short of what I ordered didn't bother call the sender, since these dice are so poorly made, I doubt it if I ever use them.

TOP 1000 REVIEWER on 14 Jun. 2012 // This is a great little set of dice and plastic counters. The set I received included yellow counters. The plastic tube is quite robust and the whole thing is no bigger than a tube of smarties. Each of the three dice have 1 side with an L, 1 with a C, 1 with an R and 3 with a single dot.The game is very simple. You start with three counters for each player and throw the three dice in turn. The letters are the direction in which you must pass a 'coin', to the person on your left or right and C going to the 'bank' in the centre. But where you throw a dot, you get to keep that number of coins.When your next turn arrives, if you have three or more coins then you throw all three dice, if you have two coins then you only throw two dice, or indeed one if you have only one coin left. The game continues until only one person is left with any coins and they then win all the banked coins.Jackpot!Instructions are included but if you've read this far, you already know exactly how to play!We were introduced to this game whilst visiting family on holiday in Ireland and we played with three 5 (euro) cent coins each. My 5 and 7 year olds were facinated by it and wanted to keep playing. The great thing is the game doesn't last too long - with 6 people, about 10 minutes per game. We played three games before the kids bedtime and it was just enough for us all.The gameplay is engaging and crucially you get to communicate and have a good laugh together. It's a great way of enjoying the company of others.It's a really inexpensive game and slips into your pocket or hand luggage if you're travelling.

 on 14 Feb. 2011 // This is so simple yet it has the excitement of ""GAMBLING""! We play it starting with 10 pennies each. We don't put out the player with no pennies, we let them wait in, not throwing the dice, but they'll get a penny passed from left or right eventually - and might win in the end! Age range in our game = 5/6 years to 84. Age 5 learnt left from right. I recommend it to get a group like this to laugh together. | No idea why this is reviewed so highly! // 1.0 // 5 Feb. 2016 // By

There is no skill involved and my kids (who have good attention spans) were uninterested after the first game we played.Only positive I found was that it encourages kids to learn left and right.Not sure what I'm missing! | Brilliant family game..... // 5.0 // 20 Jun. 2014 // By

 on 7 April 2014 // A simple concept of a game that all can play from (say) five and upwards. The game can be played with the supplied counters, but more fun is had by playing for 5 or 10p coins; further, it's a great way of introducing children into the delights of playing for money with all of the highs and lows of winning (losing) money.It's small, compact and a great travel game. | Absolutely love this! // 5.0 // 25 Dec. 2015 // By

 on 25 Dec. 2015 // This is a simple game - trying to explain it would not do it justice. It sounds dull - rolling the dice and moving the counters either left, right or centre - but weirdly, in a group of adults and kids, it really is enjoyable. I play it with the grandparents and my 4 and 6 year olds and we all have fun. It's innocent, old fashioned, anti-television entertainment! | Excellent // 5.0 // 27 Feb. 2013 // By

We play with 1p coins instead of the tokens! You need quite a few people to make it more fun but it can wipe you out of your pennies quite quickly if play a few rounds!

 on 23 July 2011 // This is really good fun to play!  Our version of the game is normally played with at least four adults and the counters are replaced by 10p or 20p pieces, so there's a pot of money to be won each round of the game.  It's a very simple game of luck, where no skill is required.  I think it's over-priced, but would still recommend it.",Games,4.8,643.25,6.0,68.0

TOP 1000 REVIEWER on 31 Jan. 2016 // Overview: These are a set of cubes which show a different image on each face. The aim of these are for the children to roll them and put them in order to make a sequence ready for a story. The child is then to use their imagination to create a story based on those characters, props and themes.The images include: house, tower, water fountain, balloon, lightening bolt, rainbow, torch, aeroplane, earth, bridges, bee, dice, turtle, eye, clock, key, masks, hands, padlock, balancing beam, compass, moon, speech bubble, stick, tent, fish, lightbulb, sheep etc.Uses: These are a fantastic resource to use in the classroom or at home. They come in a variety of styles which will suit different topics and children's interests. In the classroom they can be used individually with children or they could be used as a whole group with each child having a different image to add to the whole class story (e.g. sit in a circle and try to add a sequence to the running story). At home, or in the car journey they can be used to keep children amused and stimulated throughout.They are:> Compact, lightweight and durable.> Come in a lovely presentation box to keep them safe!> Have a different image on each face e.g a character, prop or themes/ideas.> Have a variety of themes to choose from e.g. other imagination ones and a new batman one has just been released.Would highly recommend to anyone who has children or works with them! They are fab!!!! Many hours of enjoymentActivity ideas:> Could be used to help develop EAL learners language recall. This may include rolling a dice and the children in the small EAL group need to say the key word as quick as possible. The first child to say it wins a point.Read more › | Gets the imagination working, old and young!! // 5.0 // 9 Jan. 2012 // By

Our daughter of 10 was so envious of it we then ordered her one too. We took ours on holiday over the xmas period. Out of all the electronic gizmo's our daughter took with her this game kept her amused the most, which was very refreshing when we live in a world of technology! It really made her use her imagination. We all took it in turns to create the next adventure of the story. She would write out the next chapter to the stories too. We had so much fun listening to the adventures!It is absolutley brilliant, really gets you thinking and rather addictive. And completely broadened our 10 years vocabulary and imagintion. Its small enough to pop into handbag too which meant we could use it the plane, car journey, restaurants etc etc.I totally recommend this product for all ages. Really good fun.

 on 7 Dec. 2015 // Very pleased with the Dice; they are well made, feature great colouring, are easy on the eyes and roll well (at the time of writing this, there has not been extensive play-testing but I personally have had no issues yet)However, if you are wanting the plastic box with the dice (as I did), you will want to read this next bit:Originally, I thought they all came with the boxes (as advertised) and checked the reviews for each to check. At least one customer on each product said they had received a plastic box so I went ahead with the purchase.When I ordered 5 sets of 7-dice (Opaque Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, and Purple) they all came in the plastic boxes.When I ordered 2 sets of 7-dice (Opaque Black and White), they instead arrived in plastic re-sealable bags. The bags themselves are fine but I prefer the boxes for better storage.I got in touch with the seller (SnM Stuff) who explained a number of details to me:When inquiring about the minimum number of 7-die sets to order to get the boxes -'The number at which we send them with boxes depends a little bit on which of our packers processes the order, but normally it's five. Alternatively, if you select expedited (express) delivery, we send them with the boxes, because we normally use Interlink Express and they don't have the height restrictions Royal Mail applies to large letters.'The seller also said in another correspondence - 'The boxes are more intended as a gift container, and generally don't have a long life expectancy in actual day to day usage.' So don't throw them at the wall to see if they bounce!So, order a minimum 5 sets OR choose express delivery to get the plastic box.If any issues/questions, get in touch with the seller - had extremely good customer service! | Nice dice // 5.0 // 13 Jun. 2012 // By

You get 9 cubes and the idea is to write a story using the pictures as they fall. I often only use 3 dice and write a really short 300-500 word story or a bit of prose. Extend your imagination by taking 1 dice and when the picture comes up do not take it at face value.

 on 12 Aug. 2015 // What a fantastic product for ALL ages!  There is something so fascinating about this sand that it could be placed equally in a child's playroom to a care-home for the elderly.  Would highly recommend this larger pack size for children whereas the smaller one is probably sufficient for an older relative that may find it a lot of nostalgic fun as well as an aid to keep hands moving and brains alert. | Double the sand at a cheaper price. // 4.0 // 11 Feb. 2016 // By

 on 11 Feb. 2016 // I did my homework on all the available sands of this type and gunned for this one, its not only much cheaper than Kinetic sand but you get twice as much! it makes a lovely sand mould and holds its shape, I'm worried that when my boy (16 months) next goes to the beach he will be disappointed that the real sand is not as good !  Ive been using this sand inside a stand up table (toys r us ) inside the house, in which it took 6 boxes (12kg) to fill, the only one issue I've found is that when it spills over onto my kitchen tiles it seems to leave some kind of residue that makes the floor slippery, which is strange as i once brought a bunch of foam tiles (mothercare) for baby safety which also left my wooden floors like an ice rink once removed! (glass cleaner seems to be the answer to washing the floor back to safety).  But I'm reviewing the sand itself and id have no problem recommending this motion sand, I'm pushing the kids aside to make sand castles of my own!! ;-) it says the sand is for 3 plus, but my boy is half that age and loves it, he has strong hands which is helpful as this sand does require some hand/finger pressure at times to scoop, dig & mould.  Update - having had it a few weeks now I'm finding that if left a few days without use in a colder room it goes very firm and less dough like which is not a good thing as its harder for my boy to use, so i have to spend time mushing it up to try and make it softer. so not sure if its the cold or what, but ill keep my eye on it. | Fantastic // 5.0 // 26 Jun. 2015 // By

Having seen products like this play sand on other sites, we took a gamble and bought this pack as it was both larger and cheaper.  Result? = very satisfied, it plays well (just as you might see on the online videos) - holds its shape when moulded (prepare to have all sorts of small items dfrom your kitchen used to make different shapes!

 on 8 Jan. 2016 // This is great! My children love it; they are 6 and 2. And I love it as it's so easy to play with and not really messy at all! It is much easier to build sandcastles with than regular sand; my two year old has trouble building with regular sand but she can build easily with this.Lots of these reviews say it's messier than playdoh but I don't think it is! The problem with playdoh is that it ends up stuck to my children's bums and socks after they drop tiny bits and sit/stand on it, then it dries, is hard to get off and gets carried on to carpets and furniture.This doesn't stick to hands, clothes, hair, carpets, or anything except itself. If any gets dropped you can just pick up a small ball of it and use that to clean up the little bits.If it is squashed together firmly it is really quite strong and doesn't crumble and fall down like regular sand does making it great for building elaborate sandcastles. It doesn't dry out so I imagine the structures that are built could last for a very long time if you wanted them to.It is like a cross between sand and playdoh but is better than both in my opinion. | Great Product // 5.0 // 24 Aug. 2015 // By

It is 6.5 inches in height and 2 3/4 inches wide. The orange salt runs through really quickly and lasts 2 minutes.

However, I don't think anyone who wanted super accuracy would be turning to this.  We had used the tiny timers in the past but they kept getting dropped, lost and broken in the bathroom.

The advised age range is 3 years+ but I have no issues letting my 17 month old son play with it supervised.The box contains;1 bag of kinetic/motion sand9 moulds - Seahorse, shell, car, plane, train, crab, boat, star, fish1 x roller which creates animal paw printsProps - Hat, 2 x arms, 2 x hands, 1 x eyes,  1 x antennasThe sand consistency is very strange, it is solid when shaped but does run through your fingers as detailed in the attached photo. It is very easy to mould, my son had so much fun filling the moulds and turning them over to reveal the shape. He had a little competition from the adults to play with it so it really is for the whole family to enjoy. The sand as claimed creates little mess and is very easy to tidy as it sticks to itself. The amount of sand received means you can fill 8 of the 9 moulds at one time. I plan to purchase more as my son gets older ... his dad has already been browsing the range online.I highly recommend motion sand, so much fun with no tedious tidy up at the end.I hope this review was helpful. | Great Buy! // 5.0 // 3 April 2015 // By

Fully planned to give as gifts this year, however the seller has gradually increased their price to what is now treble what they were initially selling for!  With this in mind I feel you're better off buying the real Kinetic Sand - the quality is slightly better, the price isn't much different and colours are much more appealing to children.

 on 11 Sept. 2015 // I agree with previous reviews that say that this is extremely expensive for what you get. The front picture is very misleading as the amount of sand you actually get is about a quarter of what is pictured. I also bought my daughter a separate refill pack to bulk it out a bit which turned out to be a good (but pricey) move. That said, it is the most fascinating stuff I have come across! I've no idea how it works, but it is great to play with. The kids are addicted to it and I have to confess to having a shot of it myself! | Disappointing. // 2.0 // 2 Nov. 2014 // By

VINE VOICE on 2 Nov. 2014 // I was pretty disappointed with this product as it doesn't live up to the impression given by the box art.First off the tiny hand gives a false impression of size, this thing is less than a foot square, not the large looking tray depicted. Secondly, the tray in the photo is packed with sand, the box you receive bears small print (not shown on the product page) which advises that photo shows 2lb of sand, not the supplied 1lb, so that, not only is the tray small it is less than half full.The Kinetic sand itself is interesting stuff, and our boy has found it fun to play with, however the small size of the tray does mean the stuff escapes and unless you're vigilant can make a mess. The moulds (not molds) work well and the sand retains its shape and can even be shaped to a small degree in the hand, though unless it's supported will lose its shape quickly.On the subject of mess, I can't understand why a lid wasn't included, we've resorted to using a carrier bag to put the tray in but this isn't entirely suitable as if the box gets accidentally turned upside down it makes a bit of a mess.Something I didn't consider was the environmental impact of this stuff, when it gets into the environment, as it is polymer coated sand, I can't think of a suitable method of disposal; the tray and moulds are at least recyclable. Still thinking of the environment, it is worth noting the distances involved in the manufacture and transport of the components. The sand is made in Europe, the plastics in Canada, both are then shipped to Mexico to be assembled, before shipping back out before sale.Overall, there is potential for a good toy here, though I feel I've been deceived by misleading marketing. | Much smaller tray than it appears on the box. // 3.0 // 29 Nov. 2014 // By

VINE VOICE on 21 Oct. 2014 // If you are impressed by the illustration on the box you will be disappointed with the actual contents!The moulds are tiny, not made from a very sturdy plastic and the sand is difficult to remove intact from the castle mould.You only get one colour, purple so to make play more interesting you will need to buy other colours from the range, personally I will not be doing that because the novelty has already worn off after an hour or so with a 4 year old who called the set ""silly"". Out of the mouths etc. etc.I really didn`t find the tray very useful because it is just over 20 mm deep and the sides are not even straight, thankfully I put a plastic tablecloth underneath. The kinetic sand is just okay, a bit funny to the touch but nothing special. I can see these moulds being used with Play dough more than anything else.Another small point is the packaging, it`s difficult enough to find anything in English on the box but when removing the tape from the side opening part of the instructions peeled of as well. I cannot justify the price for what you get here and do not recommend, sorry. | Great novelty toy // 5.0 // 22 Nov. 2015 // By

TOP 500 REVIEWER on 22 Nov. 2015 // This is a good ‘novelty’ product for children who are perhaps more accustomed to more usual toys. It is certainly different and it has a real novelty value that is guaranteed to grab and hold their attention.The box contains a bag of sand, a tray and four moulds. The sand itself is basically sand mixed with a harmless polymer and a bright purple dye. The polymer makes the sand grains stick together slightly so if you pack it into a mould the sand holds the shape of the mould for a while. The adhesion gradually breaks down and the sand shape slowly falls apart into semi-loose grains again. It’s a bit like playing with damp sand on the beach but the sand is more ‘sticky’ and the polymer helps give any moulded shape greater definition.The polymer itself is clean and odour-free. The sand has no distinct smell and it doesn’t leave any sticky residue on your hands. It doesn’t stick to carpets or solid surfaces or anything. If you do get any on the carpet you can just vacuum it up.The sand is coloured bright purple although you can buy lots of other colours separately if you want (the sparkly gold is really cool). For some reason the manufacturers chose bright purple as the standard colour to be used in the basic kit. In my opinion this was a questionable choice as some of the other more subtle colours are visually more appealing.You get one imperial pound (454g) of sand in the box. This isn’t very much and you will probably find yourself buying more separately. Additional sand is expensive; currently (Nov 2015) over £12 for a random coloured one pound bag on Amazon and up to £25 for a one pound bag of specific coloured metallic sand. I would advise you to be aware you could easily end up spending more than you think buying more of this product to maintain its ‘playability’.Read more ›",Art,4.3,1575.34,58.0,99.0

It's not as sparkling gold as on the packaging but it's still a nice shade, it looks a lot like real sand so it is the most realistic looking play sand that I've seen, you can make sandcastles with this that look like they're straight off the beach.  It doesn't stain your carpet and is easy to clear away, just scoop it up and put back in the bag, it retains it's soft texture.  If there are any spillages simply sweep them up or hoover them.

 on 11 Jun. 2015 // We were sent this in return for our honest review.The set is aimed at children aged 4 and above which I would agree with.  It is not something I would let my two year old daughter play with yet as I know she would become bored easily and end up making a mess instead!When the set arrived I didn’t think it looked like there was much sand in the bag to play with, however, once tipped into the tray there was plenty there to keep my son happy.He got stuck straight in, squeezing the sand together and moulding it into shapes.  He enjoyed using the roller and tools, however, I felt there could have been a couple of moulds included to keep his attention for longer.  These can be bought separately but it would be nice to have one or two included in this set.I was happy to let my 6 year old son play with the sand indoors as it is fairly mess free.  Although he wasn’t always careful to keep the sand in the play tray, what he did spill on the table was easy to clean back up into tray and I didn’t find that any stuck to the furniture or the floor.I was impressed with the quality of the play tray and tools provided and feel the set provides good value for money.  I was also pleasantly surprised that the sand fit back into the bag provided with little effort as that saved me having to have an extra storage tub – everything fits back into the box provided.Overall we are pleased with the Cra-Z-Sand Deluxe Play set and would definitely recommend it as a fun way to play with sand relatively mess free! | Fun! // 5.0 // 8 Jun. 2015 // By

VINE VOICE on 8 Jun. 2015 // Cra-Z sand is a lot of fun. It's pretty similar to kinetic sand, and sands alive in the way that it molds and moves. It is less messy than normal play sand since it sticks together differently and you won't get little sand grains all over the house, so if you are playing indoors then this is better.The set includes enough cra-z sand to play with (mine arrived in purple colour not the sand colour shown) and a tray to use while playing, plus a couple of tools like a roller and shaper but not any molds for making sandcastles or shapes. You can use any of your own sand molds though or even a cup, they will all work fine and this cra-z sand molds really well, keeping its shape better than normal sand. It is quite similar to moon sand or moon dough in the way that it moldsMy children all enjoy playing with this, ages 3, 5 and 6 | Where's the Pyramid? // 1.0 // 27 Mar. 2016 // By

 on 27 Mar. 2016 // Not happy with this purchase. My daughter was keen to sculpt pyramids and walls and the box clearly shows these, with a vague description of 1 tray, 1 roller and 3 shaping tools.The three shapes sand sculptures on the front (a tower, a pyramid and a wall) are photographed with the tray and roller. There is no disclaimer next to these stating moulds not included.A separate image of a fish mould has a small disclaimer of no mould included. This is unacceptable and bad marketing.The included tools are all flat and the included instructions describe how to fill a mould NOT INCLUDED and use the shapers to clean the sand away.I am not impressed! There should be a clear label on the front of the box that the shapes are not included.1.5lb of sand, a cat litter tray and three bits of flat plastic are sadly not worth the money.I would send this back immediately, but unfortunately the Easter Bunny bought it and my daughter opened the product. She was disappointed that the pyramid was missing, I'll now have to look for one online. | Beware, the quantity is not what you would expect for the price // 3.0 // 12 Jan. 2016 // By

 on 1 Dec. 2014 // Excellent product that works very well.  I purchased this for my 5 year old and he and his older brother have used it a lot.  It sticks well together, and I consider the materials added to be safe for my children.One challenge is where to store the sand - it's for indoors play but it can still make a mess on the carpet.  If bits fall on the carpet, the larger bits can be picked up but the small bits need the vacuum cleaner to come round.  We have used a large biscuit tin to store it in, but unless the kids play in a very tranquil way they end up spilling over onto the carpet.  I've made an order for a mixing tray to solve that problem:  MIXING TRAY, CHILDREN'S PLAY MAT, SAND PIT, WATER, PLASTIC, TOYS, POOL PIT, (Green)Update:  I decided to purchase a second kinetic sand pack for Christmas since I'm buying a mixing tray which gives extra playing space.  At the time of writing there are two sellers, in-stock seller at £33 and Amazon out of stock at £15.  I purchased the out of stock Amazon one on 6 December 2014 and received it just a few days later on 11 December 2014.  However it is still showing out of stock on Amazon today (11 December 2014).

The only real negative I found was that you need to find an enclosed 'playmat/surface' unless you want it getting everywhere and losing half of it. We ended up using a bucket lid. It is fascinating the way the sand 'moves' after you put it down after you have been moulding it in your hands.

 on 29 Nov. 2015 // Awful stuff; doesn’t stick together but it does stick to clothes. And the only way to get it back out of the carpet is to vacuum it up… which defeats the purpose (might as well use ordinary sand)We live in quite a small apartment so before buying this living sand we checked it out quite thoroughly on the internet first (didn't rely on just the maker's own video!) e.g, we watched a comparison on YouTube called “6 Sand Comparison!” it’s about 1/2 hour long, plus a “Sands Alive Starter Kit Opening & Review” and both of them show Sands Alive product with very different properties (almost dough-like). Anyway, we needed a sand that would clump together for indoor use and opted for the Sands Alive brand as it gave the broadest appeal.Sadly, the ‘sand’ in the package acts nothing like the sand in any of the videos, it's not dried out but it virtually acts as if it is; unlike being dough-like it acts as if it’s the raw ingredients for making dough and yes, it makes just as much mess. In fact it’s worse, as at least flour comes out of clothes simply by dusting off, but this Sands Alive stuff only comes out by being put through the washing machine.It was still fun for our 4-year old to play with but then again, cleaning is not one of his duties yet.The batch codes on the bag with sand are: 15010596 + 15010736The only positive I can say about this experience is that the retailer, Fun Filled Toys UK, was excellent; very helpful and provided a swift refund. | One Star // 1.0 // 22 Dec. 2015 // By

 on 24 Mar. 2016 // Because the sand doesn’t stain and is non-toxic, it is perfect for being able to play with indoors during the winter when you can’t get to the beach to make proper sandcastles!I did find it relatively mess free and, any mess that was made could be swept up easily though I will only let my children play with it in the dining room where there is no carpet.I liked that the set had a good sized tray included to play with the sand.  There was plenty of space in the trays to make plenty of sculptures and still left plenty of space for them to play with the sand.  I would have liked to have seen lids for the trays to be able to store the sand easier.The quality of the plastic modelling tools provided is great.  The plastic is strong and will stand up to a lot of play.Although Sands Alive claims to look and feel like real sand I don’t really agree.  It definitely feels more like a modelling sand than real sand which is not a bad thing.  It does, however, look more like sand than other sets we have had in the past as it is sand coloured.My 7 year old son found the sand very easy to model both with his hands and with the moulds provided.  My 3 year old daughter struggled a little, though still had fun playing with the sand.The sand came out of the moulds very easily and I was really impressed with how much detail was imprinted onto the sand.Once my son had made the sculptures they did stay standing until he knocked them down to pack the sand away.  The sand does stick together very well.For the price, I think the set is excellent value for money.

 on 23 Nov. 2015 // Kinetic sand is a good ‘novelty’ product for toddler who are perhaps more accustomed to more usual toys.We got this kinetic sand box set after seeing some in a shop on holiday, And we found that it's much cheaper online!  The kinetic sand feel great, which is quite soft. It's strangely addictive but the fact that it sticks to itself means its not too messy to have on a desk or coffee table and spillages can be cleaned up quite easily with more sand.Kinetic sand itself is clean and odour-free. The sand has no distinct smell and it doesn’t leave any sticky residue on your hands. It doesn’t stick to carpets or solid surfaces or anything. If you do get any on the carpet you can just vacuum it up.This product to be a good novelty toy for children. It is ‘different’ and it is guaranteed to get their attention and hold their interest for a while.

Moulds so easy allowing you to see the features of the moulds. It doesn't leave sand particle all over the place as normal sand does. Better than play dough. I find it a bit expensive but considering the ease of using this it is well worth the money.

 on 25 Feb. 2016 // My daughter was given this as a present at Christmas and she thought it was a lovely idea.  She finally got around to using this at the weekend and has made some beautiful looking creations that she has in pride of place next to her bed.  She has asked for another one for her birthday and also some as birthday pressies for her friends who love what she has shown them.  They kept her quiet for quite a time thinking about how the colours would look best and then finally creating her masterpieces.  The only slight gripe was that the sand settled overnight leaving a gap at the top of each of the bottles and she didn't have any sand left to top them up.  Over time when they get knocked over, they are now going to lose that initial design. | More sand please // 4.0 // 10 Mar. 2016 // By

    Adam McGee
  
 on 5 May 2009 // For fans of the original Transformer universe, Grimlock will need no introduction. However I'll give you a brief one anyway. The head of the Dinobots, Grimlock is one of the most loved characters from both the 80s cartoon and the comic strip - mostly known for his inability to do anything correctly except fight. This model is a faithful reproduction of his G1 form and follows on from the previous masterpiece versions. The model itself is just over 10 inches or so in height, a little smaller than Masterpiece Prime and Megatron, and a little taller than Masterpiece Starscream (I feel the idea with any forthcoming models is that they will all roughly be around the same size as Starscream and Grimlock, leaving Prime and Megatron (as well as - in my opinion - the pointless Ultra Magnus repaint) to stand over the rest. There is some die-cast in him, significantly less than Masterpiece Prime however and this is a disappointment given the price increase compared to other models in the line. However, if you're a fan of Grimlock, you won't be disappointed with how accurate he is - stunning in both robot and dino mode, he looks just like he was drawn in the series, right down to how his legs tuck up and form his tail. He is easier to transform than the other MP models which is a great bonus as he is undoubtedly the one you will want to have in both modes (I mean, who's going to display Megatron is gun mode?) Grimlock comes with a host of accesories, some rather superflous but all fun (my favourite is his little apron, bow-tie and drinks tray as featured in the episode Madman's Paradise). Also included are his sword, a gun, his brain-melding kit (from when he created the technobots).Read more › | Me Grimlock King! // 5.0 // 14 Jan. 2010 // By

TOP 1000 REVIEWER on 11 Sept. 2011 // NECA Predators 2010 Movie Series 3 Action Figure Classic Predator MaskedI knew this would be worth waiting for...NECAs Classic Predator as he appeared in the 1987 original, and it is PERFECT.First off, even though this figure is amazing, I felt it a little bit difficult to splash out for as this is now the FIFTH 'classic' Predator that NECAs released in the last year or so.(Series 1,unmasked. Series 2,battle damaged. Alien Vs Predator 2 Pack closed mouth and this years SDCC Gort Predator)but this version is by far my favourite.The paint job is the best yet, cleaner, less sloppiness and more screen accurate colours.It also has a great head sculpt with the mask on, and the bone trophy's it wears makes it look even more different that previous versions, and are screen accurate based on the first film. It also includes retractable wrist blade and shoulder mounted cannon.If you don't own any Predator figures, I would almost definitely go for this version - it is my favourite Predator figure ever! | Better than looks!! // 5.0 // 19 Oct. 2011 // By

 on 6 Mar. 2013 // The figure itself is breathtaking in terms of its paint and aesthetic, however even trying to bend any of the limbs slightly results in them snapping off and me having to glue them back on. I would suggest on holding off for the new improved version of this in NECA's series 8 re-release, which claims to have a much better durability. | predator // 5.0 // 8 April 2014 // By

TOP 1000 REVIEWER on 7 Aug. 2014 // The product is not what was expected at all - it is okay in quality, but definitely NOT in colour.The colour is definitely not as you would expect when someone says ""metallic"".  Metallic suggest a shiny bright finish to the product that reflects light.The *silver* is grey.  The *gold* is flesh colour - almost the same as a normal rubber band.Upon closer inspection of the pictures, when you zoom in, the pictures do reflect the real colour, although it seems to be a lot brighter.  The normal picutre without the zoom looks a lot brighter than the loom bands actually are.If you are looking for 600 grey and flesh coloured loom bands, these are ideal.If you are looking for 600 metallic gold and silver loom bands, these are NOT ideal at all.Purchase with care.  The product has been given 2 stars due to the poor description.

 on 8 Jun. 2009 // Let's get this straight, I purchased these for my daughter and she has enjoyed making designs to hang etc. However, it is my own use that has been surprising. I have found this 'toy' incredibly therapeutic and the things you can make are limited only by your own imagination. Even fat fingers like mine can play, although I do resort to tweezers sometimes.In summary, great fun for ALL the family, just don't let heavy-handed Dad do the 'ironing' as the beads and base melt VERY quickly and the base becomes unusuable if you melt the points too much.

I thought that this bucket was great value, I have made at least 20 things, some fairly large and I'm only about a third of the way down it.If I had any complaints, it's that there doesn't seem to be many black beads in it - a shame because I like to use them as an outline!No pegboards or paper with this, just the beads. Pegboards can be bought separately and grease proof paper can be used instead of having to spend more on the official Hama ironing paper.Overall I was very happy with this as a starter pack, found cheap packs of the black beads as well as brown and grey ones that I wanted online to top it up.The colours you get in this bucket are: Black, white, pink, purple, blue, orange, red, yellow, green and dark green. | Hours of rewarding creative fun, + no brand names or gimmicks. // 5.0 // 21 Oct. 2009 // By

She has made picture frames, dolls for removable paper clothes and all sorts of peculiar looking monsters. One recent creation was a hama-bead charm bracelet! My 4 year old son makes pictures of cars, dinosaurs and traffic lights and then plays with them.It is a simple concept. Put small plastic beads onto a plastic board to make a picture. Use some baking paper to iron (on a low setting) to melt the beads together, and then peel the picture off. The ""midi"" beads are suitable for about 3 and a half to 10 (or over. I'm addicted...) you can get much larger beads for smaller children, and much smaller beads for older children and adults. I haven't tried either, and we are sticking to ""midi"" beads for now.There are also the kits with the instructions on how to create the intricate pattern to make really impressive pictures. It would be nice if the manufacturers had a website where they had a few more examples you can copy. I understand that you can get books and things, but we haven't looked at these yet.The only downside is that these creations by their very nature cannot last forever if you play with them constantly or wear them a lot. But truly this toy is an all round winner. Hours of peace for parents, creative play for youngsters, and a praiseworthy creation at the end.Okay, adults, you need to iron for a few seconds after the kids have finished their work, but it is not difficult and doesn't take any time.Read more › | Hama Heaven! // 5.0 // 30 Oct. 2007 // By

 on 26 Jun. 2014 // I bought a box of these after searching Amazon for Christmas presents after reading the reviews and naïvely assuming that the boards required to put the beads on were supplied which I may add was not in the description but as I had never seen or heard about the beads before I hadn't known what to expect. Never mind the boards are inexpensive and totally reusable so the deficit when pointed out by my daughter, was soon rectified. I also assumed wrongly that it would only be my granddaughters who would be interested in the beads, but wrong again, both grandsons also like them. All four children have made a variety of imaginative things from the beads including necklaces, bracelets, table mats, nameplates, wall hangings and birthday greetings pictures for family and friends. All you need is some (reusable) grease proof paper plus an iron and one responsible person, usually a Nana (or similarly qualified person) to drop everything they are doing instantaneously to iron the beads. Actually on Hama bead days I recommend imposing a twice daily arrangement whereby creations can be left at a designated spot and then ironing done in batches. Finishing one item takes about 2 mins. For greater stability (if permitted by the artist), I tend to iron both sides. Using the beads is great when friends come to play as all ages can create things together according to their skill level without feeling in any way left out and with so many beads in a box they last for ages. The shaped boards eg butterfly's or dolphins etc are nice as give a good shape to the designs but are not necessary but do get some large boards for making multiple similar designs eg flowers used for gluing onto a plant pot to decorate it. At the price offered a box of these would make a good gift for many different occasions eg gift for one child to take to another child's birthday party. | 10 000 minutes of peace and quiet // 5.0 // 20 Jan. 2014 // By

HALL OF FAMETOP 50 REVIEWER on 20 Jan. 2014 // If you are buying Hama beads I would strongly suggest getting this set. The beads will probably land up everywhere, but at least with this big tub you can keep them all together after you've scooped them up with a brush and pan. There are a large variety of colours to choose from in the set but I also bought some extra glow in the dark ones to compliment it.The quality of these beads is great and they're really good value. The tub makes it nice and easy to pack them away after kids may get bored with them (they don't seem to stay bored with them for long though!).Highly recommended.",Art,4.7,1055.76,20.0,132.0

 on 6 Mar. 2011 // I got this for my 5 year old daughter and she absolutely loves it.  It's a brilliant starter kit for which we can buy other boards to add to it later. There are 2 of each board (2 x square and 2 x hexagon) the square and the hexagon have a different bead layout so a flower shape can be done on one but not the other.  As an adult I find the beads a bit fiddly but my daughter with smaller fingers doesn't seem to have a problem.  I'd thoroughly recommend this. | Great as a starter pack or a top up! // 5.0 // 31 Dec. 2011 // By

TOP 500 REVIEWER on 31 Dec. 2011 // My daughter received some Hama beads for Christmas.  They were a much wanted toy after she first discovered them at Brownies.  Within an hour of opening her first set she had created several different designs and was starting to run out of certain colours.  This set on Amazon seemed ideal to replenish her supplies.It comes with 4000 mixed colour beads that are split in two polythene bags.  There are also six peg boards; 3 square and 3 hexagon.  One of each shape peg board is transparent so you can lay it over the sheet of designs that's included so it can be used as a guide.Because of the number of peg boards it would be an ideal set for sharing between siblings, using at a children's party or even for clubs and groups such as Brownies, after school clubs etc.Hama beads are a brilliant 'quiet time' activity.  Perfect for when your child needs some quite amusement or you need them to be quietly amused.  Hama beads are also a great way to improve dexterity and concentration.  Designs take, on average, 10 seconds to iron meaning your child is instantly rewarded and can hold their design in their hands in under a minute after completion.I would buy this set in the future for presents.  It's perfect. | A good value starter pack // 5.0 // 4 Nov. 2013 // By

 on 4 Nov. 2013 // I'd heard about Hama beads and spent some time checking out various packs on Amazon. I went for this one as it was a cheap way to test the waters (I didn't want to spend much in case the kids were not interested).  The purchase paid off as my kids and niece have spent hours fiddling with the tiny beads, especially recreating their favourite video game characters as ""pixel art"". | Fun for everyone // 5.0 // 3 Jan. 2012 // By

 on 3 Jan. 2012 // I embarrassingly bought these hama beads for myself as I am having a bit of creative streak and fancied using hama again. I'd forgotten how time consuming it is put the beads on the board and the woes of when you knock the board (they all move) but it's great fun. You can create so many different things with it, this pack is a good idea for babysitters or people looking to engage a group of young children although to start a decent hama collection it isn't as great. 4,000 beads goes very quickly (made about seven models and half are gone already), the pegboard which come with this are very small and not as easy to use as the regular ones. It's quite a limiting set and I am glad I purchased other pegboards at the same time otherwise I wouldn't have gained so much from it.Personally I'd recommend getting a bigger pot of beads which comes with some interesting pegboarda or at least a decent sized basic one. | Good starter pack // 4.0 // 29 Jan. 2014 // By

VINE VOICE on 30 Jun. 2012 // Good item on teh whole ... although the gold tiles weren't as impressive in the overall result as I'd hoped and had to be used very sparingly; - however, the big sticking point for me was in the postage and packing.  My 3 items were all delivered in the same package ... but the postage price was phenomenal!  I seem to have ended up paying postage for each item individu7ally!  I'm sorry, but you can't tell me that 3 packs of hamma beads cost over £5 to post to me!!!!Amazon related companies; please think before you charge for postage and packaging on multiple orders placed by one customer from a single account at one time.If a customer is ordering more than one item from you; surely you need to adjust the postage and packaging prices appropriately without asking whether it is an order for a school or for other purposes?  The postage and packaginmg that this company charged was blatantly unfair.  They have offered to refund in return for my removal of negative feedback - but I would have preferred more thought and customer care at the outset. | Good value // 3.0 // 8 May 2014 // By

They don't seem to be the original rainbow ones if that's what your looking for, but they work and look pretty much like the original.They are strong and durable so far and have not broken whilst being used.In terms of colour, are a good contrast in bracelets.

 on 20 Jun. 2014 // this item took a long time to be delivered but in fairness I couldn't get them else where due to to the world cup and every one one making red and white bands for it and the red were in short supply too. The demand for the red and white will go down now so they probably be a faster delivery from now on.. but now this made my need for them expire  as  the games nearly over and too late to make the bands.. I prefer  the really white bands which I had before these are a milky dull white band but ok.. and in some making of bands may work better.. the last white ones I bough from town and were slightly thicker and  much whiter..but this has nothing to do with amazon as the band are all the same maker.. so this is a manufacture thing..I would rate amazon 5 star as the service they provide me with is excellent.. but they are not the ones who make the bands, it is a manufacturer thing, maybe they should do two types or white brilliant white and creamy white.. so my 3 star rating is due to color quality.  and length of delivery time.. | white loom bands // 5.0 // 14 April 2014 // By

I ordered a pack of 300 Metallic Gold loom bands but I received a pack of 600 yellowy-brown loom bands (a similar colour to that of standard rubber bands), which were neither metallic nor gold.I contacted the seller and received a prompt reply confirming the 'metallic gold' is actually 'caramel' and suggesting I return the product.I do think the Amazon listing is misleading.  If they aren't metallic gold but caramel in colour, they should be clearly listed as such and to this effect I am placing this feedback on Amazon to prevent other people having the same disappointment. | Good metallic silver colour // 5.0 // 14 July 2014 // By

I have only just started to paint the picture, but I am enjoying the experience and look forward to having the finished painting in due course. The paints are perfect for use, as in the past I have bought paint by numbers, not from this seller I hasten to add, and sometimes the paints have dried up.  You also get three different sized brushes, which is a novel experience for me.

 on 5 Jan. 2016 // As an experienced painter I thought it would be relaxing fun to paint this.  At nearly £18 I expected better quality and quantity regarding paint and brush sizes.  On the larger fill colours it is insufficient to completely obscure the canvas white.  The colours are several shades different in some cases, most notably the orange and range of greens.  The brown needs to be put on thicker than the quantity allows.  Not for a novice as it does require good brush accuracy and sequencing of paint application.

We had a fantastic water fight which did end up with a few casualties ie six of the pistols but they were being used quite enthusiastically by twelve year olds so I was actually amazed so many lasted.

It all packs up into the case to carry around, and the bits don't fall out if you leave the yellow swivel gates attached to block the gaps.We've also got the squirting fire boat from the same range which is a big hit. | Hours Of Fun // 5.0 // 7 April 2015 // By

Very poor quality and I would definitely not pay £12.50 for them.  My husband even remarked they looked cheap.  These were bought for my daughter's friends birthday.

 on 11 Jun. 2014 // Ok so the kit itself is absolutley tiny, i thought it would be the same size as my facepainting kit - how wrong i was!! The brushes are useless so i use cotton buds instead, the stencils that are words or have tiny details tear and little pieces get stuck to the skin, however the glitter is of great quality and the larger stencils work fine! Can be reused but removing previous glue and glitter is a nightmare so using same colour scheme is great.Overall it did do what it says on the tin but generally not great quality - i wanted this for my party business its safe to say ill be buying a better quality one as this will probably only last 2/3 parties | My niece loves it // 5.0 // 10 Feb. 2014 // By

Scalextric Digital C1296 Pit Stop Challenge 1:32 Scale Race Set Another challenge for Scalextric racers This oval circuit introduces an additional form of play with the digital pit stop, and also includes a crossover section, a banked curve, and a powerbase. Players can race as usual on this circuit or step up their skills for the Digital Pit Lane Game in which they must compete with other racers to get through the pit stop, but only when it's open! Players can select up to three pit stops per race. The pits will open randomly for ten seconds at a time, and will be randomly closed between 15 to 30 seconds at a time. Enter the pits when open to extinguish one pit stop light, but take care – if you enter the pits when they are closed you will receive an extra pit stop penalty! Extinguish all pit stop lights first to win the game. Four cars can be raced simultaneously using the powerbase provided in the set, and an upgrade to the C7042 Advanced Six Car Digital Powerbase allows six-car races plus a host of additional features. Three super-resistant McLaren MP4-12C cars come with the set.

By pressing an extra button on the digital hand throttle, you can make your car switch lanes on special sections of track, allowing you to overtake or strategically block your opponents' cars at key moments in the race. Each set comes with digital cars and more can be bought separately, and you can even convert analogue slot cars you own to digital. Most standard cars are DPR (digital plug-ready), including the ones in this set, and can be converted to digital in under a minute just by slotting in a digital plug (also available separately).

 on 8 Mar. 2013 // A great way to get a lot of expensive scalextric pieces in a bundle that saves money. But this is only a starter set and really adding to it over time is the way to go to keep it interesting. Digital scalextric is a massive jump in terms of playability over analogue sets and once you go digital you won't go back. The pit lane game is fine and adds a novelty factor and the cars are really quick. Lane changing works brilliantly. Enjoying new hobby with the kids. RecommendedWorth noting if you plan to crash lots and be rough generally, things like spoilers and wing mirrors won't last long. Aside from that the cars are pretty tough. | Great Digital Starter Set // 5.0 // 19 Dec. 2012 // By

 on 19 Dec. 2012 // I bought this set as my grandaughter has taking a liken to cars rather than dolls. She loved it and even though she's only 6 soon picked up the switching lanes and entering the pits at the right time. My only complaint as such is that you really need the lapcounter, (which I've bought)to keep track of who's winning, seeing as how you can race 4 cars with this set.(3 supplied, with 3 controllers).I have added more track and doubled the size, with the ext sets you can buy and it makes it a bit more tricky but still more fun.The standard set is good value at the current discounted price, and will keep up to 4 kids/adults happy for many an hour, my partner who doesn't normally like cars has become very competitive and can't wait to play since I bought this set.

Seriously though it's a great product - not cheap, but it's a lot more interactive than the old kits and the cars with magnets underneath do help keep them on the road - less susceptible to sliding off unaided. | Kids love it // 5.0 // 8 July 2013 // By

 on 30 Nov. 2009 // Bit of advice to any potential buyers: look carefully at the connections shown in the picture...as the manufacturers want this to be compatable with both classic and sport track, you can see the fasteners are not the same on both sides.The way this connects to your track is by a ""converter"" piece which transforms what seems at first glance to be a half-length accessory to the size of a full length track piece.  For some sets with few or no customisable straights (a figure of eight track, for example) it can be challenging to find space for it without a big rethink.Due to restricted space I ended up having to cut/file away fastenings from a couple of mis-matching pieces and super-glue them together.So, don't make the same mistake as me.  When planning your track, allow a full track length for this accessory! | Lap Counter - A useful addition // 4.0 // 5 Jan. 2005 // By

 on 5 Jan. 2005 // The lap counter is great for keeping tag of what is happening on the race track.The cars move so fast and if they do happen to leave the track, it is often difficult to work out who has done how many laps - not now.Not only does this accessory count down the laps (which can be set independently for each lane, therby introducing a handicap system) it also times each lap showing the fastest time for each player at the end of the race. This gives another ""opponent"" to beat.The set also includes a convertor straight to make it compatible with both the classic and sport track sets.Overall a great addition to any scalextric set. | Scalextric Lap Counter C8215 // 5.0 // 27 Dec. 2009 // By

Will fit older as well as newer tracks, has a half track to join on using the joiners that are different to your track, creating a full length with the same as your track joiners at each end.

 on 25 Jan. 2016 // This is the second new scalextric product we've had recently and both required modification with a stanley knife before they would  work as expected. In this case, the moulded channel for the cars was not a channel at all, so the cars just got stuck. Rather than send back and disappoint my daughter, I spent 15 minutes cutting out the offending plastic so the cars could pass un-obstructed. It now works great, but surely such a basic defect should be getting picked up before getting to the customer.My second issue with Scalextric is that there is absolutely no response from their customer service email address, other than an automated acknowledgement. So if you have any problems, don't expect Scalextric to sort them out.This and other recent experiences with Scalextric have totally put us off buying any more bits from them. | Lap counter - definately makes this more competetive! // 5.0 // 11 Oct. 2003 // By

 on 10 Jan. 2015 // Scalextric - the quintessentially British toy that every schoolboy wanted when I was a child.Is it still relevant in the digital age?This particular set certainly brings a few updates to the last time I played with a Scalextrix set.  The cars are digitally chipped, which means that they are paired to their individual controller so that a track with only two ""lanes"" can have four cars racing on it.It also means that you can have more than one car in each lane and that lane changing and even braking is now possible.This set is a really good starter set.  The track layout is quite large with the track taking up 2.5m x 1.35m and has a total of 6.3m of track.  This is about as big as I can fit in my living room!  It can also be set out in several different shapes.Set up seemed easier than previously too.  The track still has to slot together, but the clips seem to have been simplified.  The cars are simple to link to their respective controllers, so you will be racing in no time.The cars also seem to be able to stay on the track at higher speeds than I remember too! The magnatraction system they now use certainly seems to work well.The cars themselves look better than ever too.  The Bugatti Veyron in particular looks great.There are a huge amount of extras and accessories that you can get to go with your track including digital lap timers and counter.I really do think that this would be a fantastic gift for any lucky child.I had a huge amount of fun setting this up and playing with it.Please take a look at the little video I made to go with this review - I hope you enjoy watching it. | Brilliant fun // 5.0 // 5 Jan. 2015 // By

There seems to be quite a difference in the speed of the two cars too, the blue one being much slower.  Needless to say, there are arguments all the time about who has which car !  Remember too that this is a DIGITAL set and therefore needs cars which are digital ready or can be upgraded by adding a digital plug. | A perfect starting point for Scalextric digital // 4.0 // 29 Dec. 2014 // By

TOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 29 Sept. 2014 // Aimed at ages 7+, this is a fast moving, traditional Scalextric set. The set gives you a nice, basic track (totally agree with a previous reviewer, they are a bit fiddly to construct, but they do stay together well), two cars and two controllers. You can extend this set, both with extra track and with extra cars – in fact, you can race up to four at a time. However, obviously, this will involve extra cost and this is a fairly large set already and makes an excellent introduction to racing for children who are old enough to control the cars as they take the corners and race the twists and turns of the track.This was a big hit with the men in my house –both my sons enjoyed racing the cars and even my husband got involved – so it certainly has a wide age appeal. The cars do sometimes fly off the track if you go too fast and my ten year old took a little while to get used to the controls. Under 7’s might find the cars difficult to control, but it is great fun for older children. It is difficult to find toys which hold children’s attention and take them away from their games consoles, but this may well be one which the whole family can enjoy, as well as being good value for money as it give you the ability to change and extend the set to make it more difficult/interesting if you want.",Toys,4.2,14524.17,7.0,216.0

However, only 4 stars for the product as I just think scalextric needs to look at the quality feel of these controllers.  They are light and cheap and the paint job over the injection moulded plastic also looks cheap.  Changing the colour caps usually results in snapping one of the 4 retaining pins off but this doesn't affect them staying in place. | Exactly as required // 5.0 // 8 July 2013 // By

 on 7 Jan. 2012 // This set is fantastic. The cars are quite durable so high speed crashes are no problem. The 6 car power base makes all the difference especially when there is no-one to race against. The price was excellent with £200 off the normal price. The only small negative point is that the cars in the set have different top speeds making closer racing difficult when racing all six cars.

 on 26 Nov. 2015 // I am a huge slot car fan. I am wondering why Scalextric would issue a Platinum set with cars of less than platinum capability. Would it have been to much to include representative cars with lights and windshields? I am wondering what happened to Scalextric that they could not have had 6 cars of significant caliber. I was less than enthusiastic once I opened the box and saw all of the cars were the crash resistant toy variety junk. Would it hurt to include the upgrades for an additional $20 per set and dazzle people with true platinum. i had to replace all of the cars before giving it as a present to my Grandson.

The ghost pace setting allows the set up of cars to run by themselves and be able to be played against. The price was amazing with 40% off rrp, making this set reachable to scalextric fans without emptying the pockets. The only disappointment was the set being delivered without  an external box, there was just an address sticker adhered to the main box, which left the set vulnerable to damage.

VINE VOICE on 26 Sept. 2014 // I must say i fully agree with the other reviewers on this.Its got hours of fun in this scalextric and it really did take me back to my younger days and i have not had one since so been such a big gap brought back memories for me.The contents were easy to put together and easy to use,not a huge track however you do have to keep getting up to replace the car on to the track lol but i am getting better where that is concerned.The jumps seem to be a good feature i like them.Maybe this will be the start of me buying more tracks and add-ons and vehicles.I can imagine if you had a massive track set up that you could have some friends around and play it for hours.So overall its fun for what it is and i am sure younger people would love it even more. | Great fun // 5.0 // 3 Jan. 2015 // By

 on 3 Jan. 2015 // Great fun. I bought this on a lightening deal before Christmas for our two boys aged 8 and 10. They'd had a micro scalextric racing minis set a couple of years back, but this was much bigger and better quality. It also brought back memories of playing with scale trip from my younger days.The trucks are well made and sturdy and have a little bit of weight to them. The jumps are a good feature and adds to the fun of playing with this track. As long as you don't go too fast round the track the cars will stay on fairly easily.Quality is as good as the tracks I used to play with in the late 70s if not better and importantly it all fits back in the box! | The old ones are the best... // 4.0 // 30 Sept. 2014 // By

TOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 5 Oct. 2014 // Easy to set up, the parts fit nicely. The 1:32 scale trucks are lots of fun to race around and actually quite weighty so they stay on track at reasonable high speed round the bends. It does get a bit boring with the limited supplied track length so the extra track sets will be essential to make it more interesting. | Wow Factor // 5.0 // 23 Sept. 2015 // By

VINE VOICE on 24 Sept. 2014 // Since the invention of video games, how toys such as Scalextric have managed to keep going is a source of wonder to me.  With the limited controls, large amount of room required and considerable cost attached, the appeal is limited.But what Sclaextric does have going for it is its very physicality.  Actual cars, racing around a track, hitting each other, flying off corners into the skirting board when going too fast, no digital representation of racing can achieve the same.  This Monster Truck set does all of this really well.  It features the iconic Scalextric track crossover point, not once but twice, plus two jumps.  The potential for disaster is high and most races feature some.It's not for purists though, a race in Monster Truck Mayhem is exactly that - mayhem.  Crashes are frequent and its a good thing the monster trucks themselves are sturdily put together and a decent size, as it really adds to the (literal) impact.  The track design is simple (until you add your own extra track) and it takes up quite a lot of room, but it's compact enough to provide tight racing.You have to watch your speed, going flat out all the time will end in tears as the cars just won't manage the corners and jumps if you do that, but that is all part of the skill required to 'drive' in Scalextric.It's easy to put together, pretty well made and good fun.  The set isn't cheap and I worry how long it will take for the appeal to wear off, but right now my two boys and I are getting a good amount of enjoyment out of this.",Toys,4.4,1670.797487253236,1.0,225.0

 on 7 Dec. 2014 // The four carded cars this year from Micro Scalextric have been something of an experiment. If they sell well, proving to MS that they have customer interest beyond the usual sets, then there is a good chance there will be more in the future. So, if you are on the fence a little bear that in mind. For a tenner. cliché or not, you really cannot go wrong here.Over at the group I race with - google 'eahorc.com' to check us out - we have been working with MS steadily over the years, trying to get them to take the 1/64th line more seriously. The smaller scale has major advantages over the more traditional 1/32nd fare, costing much less and needing much less space to set up as a permanent track (on a board behind a sofa for example).What holds it back it that people - from parents and grandparents looking for presents that are not video games to racers such as myself - are not as aware of 1/64th as they are of the bigger, much more expensive stuff. Carded cars for a tenner are a good move. Coupled with the cars being bright and fast, they are a real winner.Bear in mind slot cars and slot car track need maintenance. At eahorc we stand ready to advise parents and other buyers how to get the most from what they buy in the 1/6th scale. Drop us a line anytime.Merry Christmas. | Good addition to set // 4.0 // 22 Sept. 2014 // By

It's nicely detailed and well printed and hasn't got any bits to break off.  It comes with spare contacts and is fairly well made.  We have found it to be as fast as the cars that we got with our set - it's nice to be able to ring the changes.

It comes with spare pick-ups/threads and appears very sturdy as there don't seem to be any parts that will break off which is good with it being for a micro track and a younger racer as it should take some bashes and indeed already has.

TOP 1000 REVIEWER on 30 Dec. 2014 // Excellent car racing model set from Hornby, I generally think of Hornby more as the train sets and towns to scale models but this is likely to appeal to anyone interested in a race track for that purpose or who is interested in racing as a table top gaming pursuit.This is an easy to assemble out of the box set, the box itself contains a cardboard inlaid mold which makes packing and unpacking the track, cars, twin controller and plug and lead less difficult, and easy to follow instructions are included. There are three inlay cards, one with illustrated descriptions of the track pieces included in the set, one with instructions of track, car and controller maintenance and finally instructions for control.When assembling the track for the first time it is a good idea to set all the pieces out as illustrated as some pieces of track are already attached in the box and appear like other pieces of track featured in the illustration (I think its a D and E part of track is similar to an F or something like that).The controllers worked fine for me but there is a means to adjust them for control and speed for new users, maybe younger users, with a simple adjustment by screwdriver.There is a lap counter included as part of the track (approaching this at the wrong speed will stop the car though, three is only one other part of the track, a semi-circular feature which requires checking speed).The controllers and plug connectors are simple and straightforward but the lead to the plug seemed short to me and I needed an extension lead and plug when racing.Read more › | Brilliant Scalextric Set For The Younger (And Older!)

TOP 100 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 9 Jan. 2015 // This is an excellent 1:64 scale track set which is one of the best sets that we have. The set advises it is for four years and over and with the hairpin bend it is definitely a track for the older racer. You do need to judge the bend and slow down for it and especially if you are in the tighter bend track (on the inside of the bend but outside of the track the rest of the way around) and quite a few times we have taken the bend too fast and the cars come off but thankfully the cars appear to be very solidly built and so far after several times shooting off the track they both still work perfectly. As the set is a micro scalextric set it is intended for the younger racer and if you are planning on getting this as a beginners scalextric set for a young child then you may wish to look at a different set as there is a skill level involved with this track that our young son cannot yet manage and so I would say this was definitely a track for the older racer.The set comes with the following:-2 Cars (one is black and the other white and both have excellent decoration on them and attention to detail - these are my husbands favourite ): scale cars that we have)1 Transformer/Plug2 Hand Controllers1 x Power Base Track Piece1 x Short Straight Track Piece1 x Long Straight Track Piece2 x Medium Straight Track Pieces6 x Long Curved Track Pieces2 x Short Curved Track Pieces1 x Lap Counter Track Piece1 x Hairpin Bend Piece2 x Track Supports/Bridge Pieces1 x Spare Parts Pack (This includes 4 new pick-ups/braids/threads and 2 new guide blade plates)There are 15 pieces of track including the power base and all of the track pieces are fully interchangeable with other scalextric 1:64 track sets.Read more › | Takes me back... // 5.0 // 29 Dec. 2014 // By

TOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 29 Dec. 2014 // It has been a long time since I have used any Scalextric so I was actually quite excited to get my hands on this.First off the micro range is for younger racers and is designed to be a gateway into the scalextric world.The set itself was very easy to set and sports a number of good features to make it a touch easier for youngsters.The cars are extremely well detailed which is nice and are built a bit tougher to withstand the vigour’s of being used by youngsters.  The magnets are extra strong too to help keep them on the track.The circuit was easy to assemble and features just over 4 metres of track.  There’s plenty of bends and turns to keep things interesting and the cars have been designed to allow drifting and 360 spins to keep it exciting.  There’s also a lap counter for keeping tally.The whole set is rather easy to setup and take down on a whim and makes it far more accessible as a result.This is a fantastic set and a great introduction to Scalextric.  Even if it doesn’t develop into a full blown hobby, or you simply don’t have the space, then it’s ideal for picking up and putting down as needed for rainy day entertainment. | and when adding the next section of track it's very easy to accidentally disconnect the previous one // 4.0 // 8 Jan. 2015 // By

VINE VOICE on 8 Jan. 2015 // I found this initially harder to fix together than the larger Scalextric kits - the track pieces are rather stiff an unyielding, and when adding the next section of track it's very easy to accidentally disconnect the previous one. I was also a little concerned when first switching it on that it didn't appear to work. However, a little fiddling with the track connections and the car contacts, and everything ran fine. In operation, it's a lot easier to keep the cars on-track than with the larger sets - I actually had the car going around the track 3 or 4 times at maximum speed, without decelerating, before it came off. This makes it a bit less of a challenge, but also means it would be suitable for younger kids who are unable to control cars on the bigger set.",Toys,4.3,4477.02,3.0,233.0

 on 15 July 2012 // I bought this car upon hearing the news that is was going to be discontinued (not sure if it was or not though). When I tested this car, I was amazed at the speed of it down the straight but when you get to a corner it is awfully hard to keep it from not sliding,which does look cool, but isn't good for your lap time. If you are a real scalextric enthusiast then you could add a stronger magnet.

 on 12 Sept. 2015 // I very rarely bother to write reviews but felt I had to for this one particularly as one of the existing views doesn't paint a fair picture.I've had a few of these and this is the best I've experienced yet. For £17 it's simply amazing. The build quality is better than one I spent twice as much on! I was attracted by how small it is and wasn't disappointed. It is true that this does limit the time the battery lasts for, but 4 mins is a fair assessment. I don't think you could expect more for anything so impressively small!It does take a little bit of practice. You're flying a four channel aircraft in your living room after all but it's gyros our well setup and as forgiving as they possibly could be. I was particularly impressed by the additional features that you'd normally have to pay a lot more for. It has trim on three of the channels; two sensitivity settings; a 3D flight mode enabling se impressive flips; and a self righting system so you can throw it into the air upside down and it'll sort itself out.For £17 it can't be beaten. | XT FQ777 124 Pocket Drone // 5.0 // 6 Feb. 2016 // By

 on 6 Feb. 2016 // Excellent service from the provider of this product  well pleased - The product itself takes some time to set up as the instructions can be hard to follow as there small in size - Once trimmed its a fine piece of kit last about 3 to 4 minutes / It comes with attachments that I recommend you fit as the blades are femma and can break if flown into any surface also continuous charging and flying over time will burn out the micro motors the drone will function but will not take off when this happens.

 on 24 Mar. 2016 // Pretty much what I was expecting, with a few little niggles but once sorted it seems to be good value for money.First snag was the charging lead didn't fit, I think there should be a notch at the top of the charging port to locate the lead it was easier to cut the lugs off the charging lead than to make a notch in the cove of the port, the connector is a one way fit only but small enough that BFI could fit it the wrong way.The rotor guard isn't the easiest thing to fit but it does its job, even after it got broken by my wife sitting on it whilst it was charging, the only thing that did so its quite robust.The instruction book...It isn't exactly right, the light stop flashing when it is paired and start to flash slowly as the flight battery runs out. Pairing hmmm Initially I couldn't get it too so I tried to change the mode, this resulted in it taking off and crashing int the ceiling when I tried to pair it afterwards I still haven't worked out the sequence properly, and it has to be done every time you charge it, annoying but worth  messing with. It seems to remember the trim setting a whilst charging which is a good thing as the small size of the controller makes this a bit fiddly a more ergonomic controller would make it nicer, but less portable so swings and roundabouts therelastly a lose hair bit of fluff or a spiders web is enough to slow the motors down and mess up the trim, This is true in my experience of all small copters, but it is a simple matter to remove the blade the hair and refit the blade. | Very happy // 5.0 // 7 Jan. 2016 // By

The suppliers are totally unresponsive as well if you send them a return request. I'm sure the flight time problem will affect a lot of these quadcopters but also there will be a lot of good ones as well, but the quality is really inconsistent. | Great product but... // 4.0 // 21 Mar. 2016 // By

 on 13 Dec. 2012 // My three year old was bought this for her birthday. We spent a good couple of hours making the puppets up and for once was good to have a kit where the adhesive (like double sided tape) actually worked. All the pieces were pre cut and of good quality. We had enough pieces left to make an extra puppet too. Nearly 6 months on my daughter still plays with her sock puppets and the pieces have all stayed stuck on. Would definitely buy again in the future for another go. Great for winter or rainy days. | Good fun // 4.0 // 30 April 2011 // By

 on 30 April 2011 // Good fun, liked the fact that everything was cut and ready to go. The inserts for the mouth of the puppets make them easier for little hands to operate.  Educationally it depends what YOU put in to it..... I got the children  to think about what sort of character they were going to make and choose the  appropriate hair and features for that character.  Talked about colours and contrasting colours for effects to make their character look zany etc.  We made up a little play after the puppets were made.  Kids really had great time.Good buy. | sock puppets forever // 5.0 // 5 Feb. 2011 // By

You still have to collect the streets, stations and utility sets and its the first to get three sets who wins.  You have money too and can be charged rent etc. but there are cards in the pack which can be played that may cause you to have to swap, sell or give up your properties. Its a great game of strategy but it doesn't take days to play.(only minutes)  We play it with the kids, age 4 and 7 and together on our own.

 on 25 Mar. 2014 // As far as I see it there are two main good reasons to buy this deck both valid:1st: You enjoy playing the game but you want to expand the experience and invite 2 other friends to play. Perhaps it's not essential to buy this add-on to go from four to a six players game, although it will considerably improves experience in my opinion, and solves some limited amount of specific cards issue.2nd: Or you want to get some new characters for you and your friends to try, and also some extra boons and banes. Expanding your experience even if you are playing it solo.I bought it for both reasons to get an extra player and increase the amount of characters available.Perhaps if I didn't have extra players to invite I would've postponed acquiring this until after I got more adventure decks.Yet I'm quite happy that I did, some of new characters easily are among my favourite and have an extra friend at the table, can't go wrong with, unless it's a tiny table ;) | Great game // 5.0 // 21 Jan. 2014 // By

 on 21 Jan. 2014 // Loving this - it's basically a card-based dungeon-crawl (even though the locations are many and varied and not restricted to dungeons).  Assemble your party, create the locations using the Adventure and Scenario cards and then go monster slaying, loot gathering and Villain-hunting.Has a really well thought out 'timer' mechanism that means it doesn't matter if you play solo or with friends - or create a party where you control all the heroes. The game lasts for the same amount of play-time (marked by flipping a card from a  deck of 30 to show each character's turn).If you like D&D, Pathfinder (obviously) or just fantasy games in general, this is for you.Note - this is the first card-only game I've bought and played, having been unsure about card games in the past. Definitely worth it. | Oh dear // 2.0 // 10 Aug. 2014 // By

 on 29 Oct. 2014 // It's not often that a simple card game gets replayed in my gaming group so often, but Love Letter is certainly one that has joined that select class of filler games.The objective of the game is simple, you want to either eliminate your opponents by playing action cards or retain the card with the highest number at the end of the game.Mechanically it is a simple 16 card game involving playing the best cards you can on your turn and deducing what each opponent has in his hand by observing the cards that have been played. Most games will take 3-5 minutes with an additional minute if you have to explain the rules and what the cards do.Because of its small size it fits perfectly as a game that you can either carry it around with you and pop it out for a quick game with your friends or as a filler game in between other larger and longer games. I would also recommend it as a good starter game if you're looking to introduce casual/non gamers due to its fun value and simplicity. | Don't be put off by the theme // 5.0 // 23 Sept. 2015 // By

VINE VOICE on 23 Sept. 2015 // When my mate first described this game to us and brought out the red velvet sack we all dismissed it immediately. It just seemed too silly and not a theme that we wanted to play ""fighting over the affection of a princess"". The mechanics also seemed ridiculous, just pick up a card and play one until you're out or no cards are left? It felt like a card game your grandmother would teach you on a wet afternoon when you were 8.A year or 2 on and hardly a games session goes by without us playing this game. It's super fast and light - perfect to play while waiting for someone or in between big games like a sorbet between courses to cleanse your palette. It's easy to pick up and has a bit of strategy to it despite the simple game mechanics. We also find ourselves getting into the spirit of the theme which adds to the fun and makes us laugh. The size of it also makes it perfect to take with you on trips for a quick game on holiday or as an ice breaker.In summary I can't recommend this game enough to have in your collection. | King and a Princess... uh oh! // 5.0 // 1 Aug. 2014 // By

 on 1 Aug. 2014 // Who knew 16 cards and 13 little red cubes could become such a great game? It's fast and frantic, and hilarities are sure to ensue. Each round requires a player to pick up a new card and then discard a card, all the while trying to keep your identity hidden, go for big numbers, and find out (and eliminate) the other players. Turns plays out differently from game to game, but each time, just as you're starting to get an idea of who has what and how to beat them, the round ends! It's great! Don't get me wrong, you're paying for the idea here, as the contents of the game are very minimal, but it's hard to find a better card game for the money. | Highly recommended // 5.0 // 14 Sept. 2015 // By

It's easy to pick up after a few plays and I don't think reading ability is a problem as the picture characters are easy to recognise.

HALL OF FAMETOP 50 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 30 April 2015 // The Metal Horse  Bicycle Deck was released to celebrate the Year of The Horse in 2014.(So the cards were actually published in 2013)They really are an elegant looking pack.If you want to know what the other  'Horse' years were so that you may give the pack as a thoughtful gift  they were ; 2014, 2002, 1990, 1978, 1966, 1954 and 1942. But the years overlap so perhaps you may wish to consult a website specialising in this?Now Horses are known for have great  personalities, such as warm-hearted, upright, easygoing, so that We  usually have a lot of friends flocking around.As to weaknesses well loving spending is just one so maybe that's why you find them shopping on Amazon?As you may have guessed, without giving my age away, that  I am a 'Horse' myself.But back to the deck.The Court  are traditional but have a metallic- almost bronze look with the reds and greens  subdued and the matt gold to the fore.Now the backs of these cards are truly magnificent.The Warrior Horse has a fine border of scrollwork which gives an unexpected effect when fanned.When you fan them the scroll like patterns seem to merge and form new, intricate designs.Move them slightly and the kaleidoscopic effect is constantly repeated as the designs blend, reform and move.Absolutely first class for magic tricks which I sometimes perform.This more than makes up for the design- the metal horse being just one way rather than uni directional.The deck, being Bicycles' usual high standard has air flow so the cards are brilliant to handle.This is an attractive and impressive deck for magicians the sheen looks really professional.Read more › | great // 5.0 // 13 Dec. 2014 // By

 on 29 Dec. 2015 // Got this to play with the family over Christmas as we all like a quiz.  This was a great spin on Trivial Pursuit as doesn't take potentially hours to play.  We played without using the buzz card as we didn't really like the 'quick' idea of stealing someone's question but having to buzz the card, was almost like snap.  Good idea for a quick thinking game.  Only issue is the same as what other people have commented, you only get a small number of question cards.  The questions are a good mix, nothing too easy but nothing too difficult to make it impossible.  Only problem we had is we got through the pack so quickly we ended up getting some same questions twice, but that's one way to learn. | Five Stars // 5.0 // 19 Jan. 2016 // By

HALL OF FAMETOP 50 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 2 May 2015 // The Alchemy England 1977 by Bicycle is a really wonderful deck.The 1977 refers to the date  Designers- Alchemy  established themselves to the world. The theme is a mash up Gothic, Steam Punk, Bikers, Skulls, Magic, Tattoo, Betty Page Pinups from the 40s and... well if you get to see the deck you will understand what I mean.Each of the 52 cards - 56 if you count all of them has a different art picture.There are 2 Jokers, One spare Joker and a Trade card which has the same back as the rest but the front a side view of the skull- wonderful.This differs from other decks where it is only the Court cards and the Jokers that have  the art.There are no additional 'Gaff' cards alas which is a shame but perhaps, because the deck is so wonderful we may be too greedy expecting one? The backs and box feature a Skull but if you look hard enough you will see the Trompe D'Oriel of a girl a 'Gestalt switch' I believe.My favourites when forced to chose has to be the two Jokers, one featuring Bare 'Knuckle Betty' the other  a steam punk girl atop a motorised Penny farthing.As to the suites for me Clubs wins hands down. The King features a Victoria gentleman walking down a London Street up to no good.Each of the four suits, hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades have been reinterpreted the clubs looking almost unrecognisable being more circular - more like the coins symbol from The Tarot, French and Italian decks.The cards are poker size, indeed it is a poker deck .The deck, being Bicycles' usual high standard has an  air flow finish  so the cards are brilliant to handle.Read more › | Awesome deck // 5.0 // 1 Mar. 2014 // By

See how your favourite pooch scores on categories including Weight, Height, Guard Dog Skill, Rarity and Loveability. So cute you'll want to take it to bed and cuddle it!Top Trumps has been played since the 1970s when the first packs took the playgrounds of the UK by storm. And its success is partly due to how easy and compelling it is to play: shuffle and deal all the cards face down. Each player takes their cards and holds them so that they can see the top card only. The player to the dealer's left starts by reading out a selected statistic (e.g. Weight or Speed). The other players then read out the same statistic from their own top cards. The player with the best or highest value wins and places all the top cards including their own to the bottom of their own pile. It is then that player's turn to choose a statistic from the next card. If two or more cards share the top value or data is unavailable for that statistic, then all the top cards are placed in the middle and the same player chooses from the next card. The winner of that hand takes all the cards from the middle as well. The person with all the cards at the end is the winner, easy.","Technical Details Item Weight100 g Product Dimensions8.6 x 14 x 2.2 cm Manufacturer recommended age:3 years and up Item model number5838 Main Language(s)English published, English original    Additional Information ASINB000BM8CPW Customer Reviews amznJQ.onReady('popover', function() { (function($) { if($.fn.acrPopover) return; var popoverConfig = { showOnHover:true, showCloseButton: ""ontouchstart"" in document.documentElement, width: null, location:'bottom', locationAlign:'left', locationOffset:[-20,0], group: 'reviewsPopover', clone:false, hoverHideDelay:300 }; $.fn.acrPopover = function() { return this.each(function() { var $this = $(this); if(!$this.data('init') && typeof $this.amazonPopoverTrigger === 'function') { $this.data('init', 1); var ajaxURL = '/gp/customer-reviews/common/du/displayHistoPopAjax.html?' + '&ASIN=' + $this.attr('name') + '&link=1' + '&seeall=1' + '&ref=' + $this.attr('ref'); var myConfig = $.extend(true, { destination: ajaxURL }, popoverConfig); $this.amazonPopoverTrigger(myConfig); } }); }; window.reviewHistPopoverConfig = popoverConfig; var jqInit = window.jQueryInitHistoPopovers = function(asin) { if (typeof $('.acr-popover[name=' + asin + ']').acrPopover === 'function') { $('.acr-popover[name=' + asin + ']').acrPopover(); } }; window.doInit_average_customer_reviews = jqInit; window.onAjaxUpdate_average_customer_reviews = jqInit; window.onCacheUpdate_average_customer_reviews = jqInit; window.onCacheUpdateReselect_average_customer_reviews = jqInit; amznJQ.onCompletion('amznJQ.criticalFeature', function() { setTimeout(function() { amznJQ.declareAvailable('acrPopover'); }, 10); }); })(jQuery); }); amznJQ.onReady('acrPopover', function() { jQuery('.acr-popover').each(function() { if (typeof jQuery(this).acrPopover === 'function') { jQuery(this).acrPopover(); } }); }); 4.3 out of 5 stars See all reviews 48 reviews 4.3 out of 5 stars Best Sellers Rank 41,206 in Toys & Games (See top 100) #119 in Toys & Games > Games > Travel & Pocket Games #1016 in Toys & Games > Games > Card Games Shipping Weight100 g Delivery Destinations:Visit the Delivery Destinations Help page to see where this item can be delivered.

TOP 500 REVIEWER on 26 Sept. 2008 // I bought a set of these for our 6 year old for his seventh birthday, and you know the story, the more expensive presents hardly got played with, but these cards I am not surprised that they are not dog eared (pardon the pun).The cards are quite well made, not flimsy cheap card the printing and pictures excellent. Plus they are quite educational, which also helps, as afterall if the child is having fun playing, they sometimes don't realise just how much knowledge they have gained, but ask a simple question about one of the Dogs a few days later and you will be amazed at just what they have picked up.They have been played with non-stop, I didn't play these with our daughter the first time they came out, and I have now seen what I have missed out on.  Even I have tried to play the game, you should try them!All we heard in the car on a very long journey were questions about the dogs, these were being asked backwards and forwards, I think I know more about the weights and different breeds of dogs than ever.  At least it stops the question of 'are we there yet?'  I would glady buy another set of these cards (have noticed that there are different categories) as they really do stop the boredom from setting in, plus you don't need a table or surface, (could cut that time of boredom at the airport departure lounge, or anywhere else there is likely to be a delay).Great cheap stocking fillers and something that all ages can play, can get the more girlie type categories for girls, or the boyish ones, so basically something for everyone including adults. Useful to have in over the Christmas/summer holidays when people get together maybe of different ages, as age six to teenagers can play happily whilst the adults can talk or whatever.Read more › | Awful fish-eye lens pics of puppies // 1.0 // 26 Dec. 2013 // By

 on 28 Dec. 2014 // Miss Information is a villain expansion for Sentinels Of The Multiverse; in the pack you get the standard villain cards (a character card, a set up card, and her deck) plus a divider for the box.This is a very well designed deck that shows off how versatile the Sentinels game can be; without changing any rules, the deck mechanics themselves make this a really unique villain who plays vastly differently from any of the others. Essentially she starts off invulnerable (simulating that the heroes don't yet know she is a villain), and the team have to withstand her shenanigans until a number of clue cards come up, after which she flips and a more standard battle erupts. She's a mid-level villain in that she lacks the firepower to be truly dangerous but - with a good draw on her part - can be very frustrating to play against given her ability to hamper the heroes by wiping out their equipment pretty easily; a hero with good deck manipulation skills can generally tame her without too much trouble though.Definitely worth getting, as the pack is pretty cheap and adds yet more variety to the wonderfully rich Sentinels experience! | Great Expansion, Because you cant attack untill miss information ... // 5.0 // 29 Aug. 2015 // By

 on 29 Dec. 2014 // Great compact game. The cards are fairly small, probably because they have to be arranged sequentially on a table (get your glasses at the ready). It was surprisingly difficult - even my husband who is annoyingly good at history got some wrong when the dates were close together. Because of this and because there are some things that can be used as clues it helps to even up the chances for the kids. My 9 year old daughter beat me twice, not because she knows more history but, because she has a smart kid's  brain that remembers things from previous games and puts clues together better than me. Maybe, after multiple games, the cards will be memorised (we'll see and it probably won't be by me). Each game lasted about 20 minutes to half an hour for three of us. Quick start - no rules to wade through. Think it will be educational because it prompted discussion and awareness of discoveries even if exact dates aren't memorised. looks like other cards in the series could be added to expand the game. | A fun game in a funky tin // 4.0 // 6 Aug. 2014 // By

 on 6 Aug. 2014 // The timeline series is a fun little game for the end of the night, or even as a small after dinner game. Everyone gets a card with a picture and an event named on it. They take it in turns to place that event into the timeline (made up of previous correctly laid events), if you get it wrong draw a new event. The winner is the first to place all of their cards.The discoveries set can cause a few arguments if you have some 'armchair historians' as a few events have debatable dates. | Great value for money. // 5.0 // 19 Feb. 2015 // By

 on 24 Feb. 2014 // Components – really nice components, plastic ships, thick card stock – really impressive.Game play – A single play through will get most people up and running. If you get stuck just YouTube it and watch the ‘watch it played’ video (or enough to get the turn sequence down).Only played 2 player so far. The games are very close – this makes the game a great game in my opinion. I find my ability to min/max strategy can sometimes destroy the fun of a competative game - especially if its got a single killer strategy.I have only played a few times but I tried out what I thought was the ‘killer’ strategy against the missus early on. I failed - I now understand that this game needs you to play the other player and the cards they play or hold as much as playing to your own strategic strengths. When I min-maxed down one path my wife 'played' me. It was still extremely close, and we both thought I was going to win when my killer combo's kicked  in and I got heaps of late game VP - but in the end my wife won through limiting my effectiveness. To me this was a real treat. I love it when other people see things I dont - it was really sweet.I’m not sure how well this game would scale but I have a suspicion that it would work okay in a 3 or 4. It may be geared more heavily to strategic choice though as with 4 players going at different strategies, the likelihood is that defensive plays may be negated… | Set in the same universe as Race for the Galaxy // 4.0 // 13 Jan. 2013 // By

HALL OF FAMETOP 50 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 24 April 2015 // The Bicycle Vintage ""Dragon Back"" Deck is a really smart looking pack but with the Blue deck they really have taken it to a new high.The big attraction is that the Red Pips- Hearts and Diamonds are in a smart blue.This always impresses and I have some of my best tricks on this colour switch.The Court cards have a great look with a toned metallic green which looks- well regal.Of course the big attraction is the card backs which it is reputed is an old design filed and forgotten for years then rediscovered by a worker at Bicycle.They liked the design and chose to release it to the public.This is an attractive and impressive deck for magicians the sheen looks really professional.Certainly when I use it for tricks it really gets the trick off to a good start if you have a great looking deck like this.The red dragons give and Oriental air of mystery so to speak.There is an additional 'Gaff' card.It's double backed so nothing to write home about but an extra which is always welcome.The back includes a couple of 'Trade' cards which are always useful if you need to make your own Gaffs.In actions the cards perform well.They fan out and are easily manipulated as are all Bicycle brands. The airflow ensures the slide easily.I used to used 'Bee' brand for many years. Bee are a subsidiary of Bicycle but I must admit I prefer to use Bicycle.A really smart looking deck that performs well.The cards are also available in Blue.The Bicycle Vintage ""Dragon Back"" Deck is a really smart looking pack.The Court cards have a great look with a toned metallic green which looks- well regal.Read more › | this deck is amaZING!!! // 5.0 // 28 July 2011 // By

 on 5 Mar. 2008 // Brilliant! My girls (aged 6/9/10 when we first bought it) have played this loads, especially on a camping holiday round Europe. All the Gamewright card games are great because they're essentially so simple, yet they have a design and wit about them that makes them very appealing. This game was inspired by an idea from a girl of about 6 and her (games inventor) dad so they've got the target market exactly right. A safe buy for a girls' birthday, I would say. | Simple but so clever // 5.0 // 4 Aug. 2009 // By

 on 4 Aug. 2009 // I can but endorse previous reviewers comments and try to add some more. Gamewright's card games are based on tradional card games with a twist and obviously a totally different set of cards. Sleeping Queens appealed instinctively to both my 6 year old son and 8 yar old daughter. We play it endlessly and it's one of those games that will be treasured and passed down generations. It's portable and absorbing and never fails to be a popular option from both adults and children's points of view. It's simple but keeps all sorts of people interested in playing. We will certainly be investing in more of Gamewright's games. | Great fun even with a tantrummy six-year-old // 5.0 // 23 May 2012 // By

 on 23 May 2012 // My little niece (I don't think my sister would like me to use her name) is a delightful child at best, but doesn't like losing. I was a bit apprehensive about introducing her to a new game, because I was afraid that if she didn't win she would have a tantrum. To my great relief, though, she and her nine-year-old brother had a great time with it. The game itself is easy to learn (though admittedly my niece often had help), the pictures delightful, and play contains plenty of chances for the lead to change hands without being too random. The authors have done particularly good work in making sure the rules are clear. At one point, in a round when the winning score was 40 points, I scored 45. My niece shouted ""You broke the roo-els!"" I referred to the leaflet in the box, and there is a roo-el which says that you don't have to have that exact number of points to win: just to have that much or better. As well as playing it with the adults, the children also played it by themselves, which I felt was a sign of its success. As the game involves only cards, it would be easy to take on journeys to play in a train or aircraft, though I haven't let my sister remove it from this house because it was so popular here. The minimum age limit of 8 is probably sensible, because it requires arithmetic, but as the queen cards which have the scores on them don't have to be kept secret it is quite possible for a child who can't add to leave them out in the open and have someone else add the scores up. Strongly recommended. | Right Royal Fun // 5.0 // 16 Oct. 2008 // By

 on 23 Oct. 2013 // Sleeping Queens is currently our family's favourite card game, requested over and over again by our 5yo and (almost) 8yo and equally enjoyed by us parents. While the age recommendation is from 8 years, our 5yo has no problems with the rules and tactics of the game (although she does need help with basic addition which is a minor component). Highly recommended, as well as the other Gamewright card games, where the ones we have tried all have great staying power:- Duck Duck Bruce (simple push your luck game, perfect from as early as 3-4 and great fun for adults as well, our favourite after Sleeping Queens, perfect to bring to restaurants/airports)- Zeus on the loose (great fun and a game we happily play with our 8yo, but slightly higher age bracket than Sleeping Queen as addition skills are needed (although of course children learn unknowingly as they play...))- Rat a Tat Cat (the first Gamewright game we tried with our then 5,5 yo, a firm favourite for a year or so until displaced by Duck Duck Bruce, but still very much recommended.)(Come to think of it, we have also tried Too Many Monkeys which is quite uninteresting, at least to adults.

Then it's time for Uno, the classic card game, which is quick to learn, easy to play and fun for all the family. The aim of the game is to be the first player to score 500 points, by getting rid of all the cards in your hand before your opponents. You score points for all the cards left in your opponents' hands. The rules of Uno are simple. Every player picks a card and the person who draws the highest number deals (Action Cards count as zero at this stage). Once the pack has been shuffled, each player is dealt 7 cards. The remainder of the deck is placed face down to form a DRAW pile. And the top card of the DRAW pile is turned over to start a DISCARD pile. The person to the left of the dealer starts play and has to match the card on the DISCARD pile, either by number or colour. So, if the card is a red 7, the player must put down a red card or any 7 card regardless of its colour. Alternatively, the player can put down a Wild Card. If the player doesn't have a card to match the one on the DISCARD pile, they must take a card from the DRAW pile. If this can be played, the player is free to put it down in the same turn. Otherwise, play moves on to the next person. Players may choose not to play a playable card from their hand. If so, they must draw a card from the DRAW pile. If playable, that card can be put down in the same turn, but the player may not use a card from the hand after the draw. Players race to get rid of their cards and the real fun starts when special Action Cards are used to foil opponents and gain an advantage.

TOP 1000 REVIEWER on 5 Oct. 2011 // Like many people, I had heard of the card game Uno, but didn't really know anything about it or how it was played. This changed last summer, when we went on holiday as a family to Whitby. Six of us were staying in a self catering cottage, and my mother in law was singing the praises of this card game that she had been playing a couple of weeks earlier when she visited her sister, saying it would be the perfect game to play as a family indoorsif it was raining (which it was!).She managed to pick one up from the local toy shop for £[], which seemed a bit of a steep price to pay for what was essentially a pack of cards! The game is made by Mattel, brand leaders in the games industry and is suitable for 2-10 players. The box states that it is for ages 7+, but I think most kids over 4 would manage the game relatively easily, as it is quite simple.The game itself is very similar to a card game that we used to play with a regular deck of cards, in which someone puts a card down and the next player has to follow suit or number and if they can't they have to pick up a card. The winner is the person to get rid of all of his/her cards first.Uno have simplified the game further, replacing the traditional suits of cards with four bold colours: blue, green, yellow and red. Most of the cards have number values on them from 0 to 9. A set number of cards are dealt to each player, with the remainder forming a pickup pile on the table. The aim of the game is to play clockwise around the table, with each player placing a card that matches the number or colour of the previous card placed, with the object of losing all of his/her cards.Read more › | There's even a typo in the Instruction // 3.0 // 29 Oct. 2015 // By

Also I noticed that on the back of the package it has ""Maximum retail price: ₹129 "" and the manufactory address is India I guess, what's worse the instruction inside I noticed a typo in ""Going out"" section, read ""If you don't yell 'UND'"" ?? it clearly printed 'UND' as opposed to ""UNO"".I can still use this cards but I'm not sure if this is the geniune UNO cards | Great game for all ages // 5.0 // 30 Dec. 2012 // By

Read the reviews about it being some sort of unofficial version. I don't believe this to be the case. The box and the cards are of high quality. Didn't need to read the instructions as we already knew how to play it. Only downside (and hence the 4 stars) is that the cards don't shuffle well like playing cards should. It's as if the card is too thick or has too blunt an edge. However I am sure with plenty of use they will become more pliable and shuffle more easily. | Fantastic Family Card Game // 5.0 // 14 Jan. 2014 // By

TOP 1000 REVIEWER on 14 Jan. 2014 // Uno is a fantastic family card game that's really stood the test of time.I can remember enthusiastically playing this as a child, and now my children received it for Christmas we play it just as enthusiastically as a family.  The rules are so simple, they're almost self-explanatory; one game is all you need to master the rules. Just like in an adult card game it's all about concealing your hand from your opponents and playing each card strategically; the aim is to get rid of your hand first.You can play Uno one game at a time or keep a cumulative score, with the winner from each round scoring points for the cards left with his opponents; the supreme winner being the first to 500.Since we got our Uno game I've discovered more other, grown-up friends who play it too, instead of normal card games. And there are so many variations to play, including multiplying the consequence cards and quick-fire rounds.We spent New Years Eve playing this with friends and their children, with around 8 players; we had a fantastic night, filled with fun and laughter.Uno is a brilliant, versatile game that appeals to all ages from around six years and up. And as it's just an large deck of cards it's small enough to pack for holiday, take on long journeys or play anywhere when you have a bit of free time on your hands.Recommeded!! | dissatisfied with the quality // 1.0 // 17 Feb. 2014 // By

Making a great deck of cards isn't easy; the only thing that matches our attention to detail is the level of quality control that we, along with USPCC exercise with our custom decks. Many months of work went into the redesign and precise printing and manufacturing of the White Raider deck, the original design was perfected and tweaked to take the elements that allowed the Black Raiders superior manipulation and push the boundaries of what we could do with the White Raiders. Where the Black Raiders looked dark, looming and powerful the white raiders bring a balance and mystique to the design. Where oily black gives way to an airy white, the cards seem to float through your fingers, we kept the highest casino grade stock, and Bicycle's air-cushion finish to provide unparalleled durability and glide. The colour scheme has been updated and refined to reflect the more elegant theme. With red and black pips on bone white card stock these cards more easily blend with some of your favorite card gaffs without compromising high contrast ratio and are friendlier to old school card mechanics.

Making a great deck of cards isn't easy; the only thing that matches our attention to detail is the level of quality control that we, along with USPCC exercise with our custom decks. Many months of work went into the redesign and precise printing and manufacturing of the White Raider deck, the original design was perfected and tweaked to take the elements that allowed the Black Raiders superior manipulation and push the boundaries of what we could do with the White Raiders. Where the Black Raiders looked dark, looming and powerful the white raiders bring a balance and mystique to the design. Where oily black gives way to an airy white, the cards seem to float through your fingers, we kept the highest casino grade stock, and Bicycle's air-cushion finish to provide unparalleled durability and glide. The colour scheme has been updated and refined to reflect the more elegant theme. With red and black pips on bone white card stock these cards more easily blend with some of your favorite card gaffs without compromising high contrast ratio and are friendlier to old school card mechanics.

 on 23 Oct. 2013 // This addictive game combines a great theme (Greek mythology) with good tactics and some basic math thrown in. It plays quickly and we often bring it out with our 8yo son, equally enjoyed by him and us adults.Highly recommended, as well as the other Gamewright card games, where the ones we have tried all have great staying power:- Sleeping Queens is currently our family's favourite card game, requested over and over again by our 5yo and (almost) 8yo and equally enjoyed by us parents. While the age recommendation is from 8 years, our 5yo has no problems with the rules and tactics of the game (although she does need help with basic addition which is a minor component).- Duck Duck Bruce (simple push your luck game, perfect from as early as 3-4 and great fun for adults as well, our favourite after Sleeping Queens, perfect to bring to restaurants/airports)- Rat a Tat Cat (the first Gamewright game we tried with our then 5,5 yo, a firm favourite for a year or so until displaced by Duck Duck Bruce, but still very much recommended.)Frog Juice also get great reviews, will be ordering it for Christmas this year!(Come to think of it, we have also tried Too Many Monkeys which is quite uninteresting, at least to adults.

 on 8 Dec. 2015 // I was a big fan of Game of Thrones Living Card Game (LCG) 1.0 and was heavily invested in that game. In all honesty though 1st edition had run its course with it extensive card catalogue, which made it difficult for new players, and broken game mechanics the game needed a complete re-boot. At first I was gutted that I would have to re-buy all the cards and start again as none of the 1st edition cards can be used in 2nd edition, but after seeing the new cards in 2nd edition I can see it's totally worth it! Of all the LCGs available Game of Thrones has always been my favourite.The designers have done a fantastic job tightening up the mechanics of the game and making it simpler. Be under no illusion, this is a complicated game to play when you take into account all the rules and then each cards abilities, where those abilities fit within the turn structure etc. However, compared to 1st edition, this is now much more thought out. There is now a lot more focus on challenges, challenge based effects and playing the game rather than a card having super abilities that completely cripple an opponents decks ability to make challenges in the game!I love the whole Game of Thrones lore and this game allows you to immerse yourself in eight different factions of the series. There are more characters than from just the TV series but you don't have to have read the books to appreciate the game. The factions included are Stark, Lannister, Baratheon, Targaryen, Greyjoy, Martell and new to second edition Tyrell and Nights Watch.One of the biggest appeals for this game is deck building. Straight out of the core box you can make decks, most by allying two factions together to give you enough cards in a deck (e.g.Read more › | Get it // 5.0 // 11 Oct. 2015 // By

 on 21 Dec. 2006 // Shonen Jump's Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game is a card game based on the popular anime (Japanese animation) of the same name. This structure deck is basically a pre-constructed deck of 40 cards based on the Spellcaster theme. Also included within are the game mat, rule-book (v. 5) and tips on using this deck. This deck is meant for the Experienced duellist.If you like the Dark Magician, this is the deck for you! Not only does it feature never-before-released cards like the Dark Eradicator Warlock, the deck also brings together cards that use the new concept of Spell Counters to maximum effect.Although a pretty good deck in itself, there's plenty of room for expandability.Card list:1 x Dark Eradicator Warlock1 x Dark Magician1 x Chaos Sorcerer1 x Chaos Command Magician1 x Mythical Beast Cerberus1 x Gemini Elf2 x Magician of Faith2 x Skilled Dark Magician2 x Apprentice Magician1 x Breaker the Magical Warrior1 x Royal Magical Library1 x Tsukuyomi1 x White Magician Pikeru1 x Ebon Magician Curran1 x Blast Magician1 x Rapid-fire Magician1 x Magical Blast1 x Mystical Space Typhoon1 x Nobleman of Crossout1 x Premature Burial1 x Swords of Revealing Light1 x Mage Power1 x Heavy Storm1 x Diffusion Wave-Motion1 x Reload1 x Dark Magic Attack1 x Spell Absorption1 x Lightning Vortex2 x Magical Dimension1 x Mystic Box1 x Nightmare's Steelcage1 x Call of the Haunted1 x Spell Shield Type-81 x Pitch-Black Power Stone1 x Magic Cylinder1 x Divine Wrath | It's good and durable // 5.0 // 27 Jun. 2006 // By

 on 5 Aug. 2009 // This is a good product. Not as excellent and unbeliievably good value as I first thought, however.Although I lack common sense of any kind, even my friends agreed that the product description for this product was misleading; You see it says ""This 100 card set..."" yes? Well, actually, that refers to the actual set the selected cards come from.Here is what you get:by 3 booster packs, they mean 28 cards (9 in each pack), and you do get the rare card as well - making it 29 cards in total.I, being a new yu gi oh fan, naturally assumed that there would be 33 cards in each pack, plys the 1 rare card, bringing the total to 100 (thus being a 100 card set).

However, I had to forewarn him that he might be disappointed, because he thought he was buying 100 cards.It wasn't until after I'd placed the order that I re-read the Technical Details and realised that he'd seen 100-card set and thought 'what a good buy'.  I explained that I'd also read this and initially thought the same as him, but read further and only then thought this was possibly too good to be true, which so it turned out to be!

 on 16 April 2013 // The boxes fit plenty of cards inside them while sleeved in the plastic sleeves.The sleeves fit perfectly and I am pleased with how the cards look and feel with them on. It also allows for easy shuffling without damaging the edges of the cards at all because the sleeves slide between one another.If you are looking for a box to hold a deck (could easily fit 90 sleeved cards inside) then this is a good choice. I am pleased with the product and if I need more deck boxes and sleeves, I will get these again.The delivery was on time, and the box was in good condition containing the deck boxes I ordered. | Good but good enough? // 3.0 // 26 Oct. 2015 // By

 on 23 Nov. 2015 // I've had these card boxes 2 days now and can honestly say I'm really happy with my purchase, I've seen a few reviews saying they're not all that great.. Let's get things straight first you get what you pay for if I was spending over £5 on a deck box yes I would expect better quality! But these deck boxes are fairly cheap and do what they say on the tin. Fortunately for me, the boxes I've got are fantastic!If you're simply looking for a deck box to match your card sleeves or just a deck box to keep your cards safe I do recommend these if you're on a budget or just not willing to spend a lot of money. I've got so much faith in these I've ordered 3 more for my other decks.I definitely recommend! | No Card Sleeves. // 4.0 // 14 Nov. 2013 // By

TOP 1000 REVIEWER on 19 Sept. 2012 // This is E.T based on the scene where he gets drunk whilst home alone.Its got a brand new head-sculpt,(glazed eyes, teeth showing)and clearly he's had a few cold ones, and he is wearing a newly sculpted shirt.As you can see by ALL production photos, even on the back of the box itself, this figure was due to come with a can of beer (see the photos- his right hand is sculpted to hold it) but licensor's didn't want kids thinking E.T is a hobo, so this ideas was scrapped. The figure comes a newly sculpted right hand now more like his left.He also includes interchangeable longer neck, his flowerpot and a Speak N Spell.I'm pretty sure Series 2 will be NECAs last E.T wave, but we have four amazing figures I thought I would never see. | Five Stars // 5.0 // 9 April 2013 // By

 on 5 Feb. 2016 // I adore Adventure Time and I purchased this item to go with my AT notebook. I thought this would be a quirky little stationary set and to be honest I wasn't expecting an amazing product due to the low price. I was pleasantly surprised however. The pencils are of great quality. I was expecting them to be cheap pencils with a patterned wrap which was of poor quality and fall off. However this pencil is not at all cheap and scratchy like I was expecting. It is a great quality pencil and I haven't had any issues with it. The lead is strong and does not break. The AT pattern round the outside is great too. It is of high quality and has not worn at all. I haven't used the rubber yet but I look forward to using it. It feels like a rubber should and not one of those plastic coated ones that smudge rather than erase. I have used the sharpener and it does the job. I love the fact that it has a little cover that can hold the sharpening waste until I go and empty it.

 on 13 Dec. 2013 // Item came well very packaged (had a recent bad packaging experience elsewhere on Amazon) and was dispatched promptly within the seasonal rush. It's actually bigger than it looks in the picture and in a sturdy box. Given as a gift to someone who asked for this set, so can't comment on quality of what's inside. | Horrible Histories Awesome Art Set // 4.0 // 21 May 2014 // By

HALL OF FAMETOP 50 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 21 May 2014 // This art set includes an art pad (of plain paper), three stencil sheets (pirates, Egyptian patterns, castles/swords), ten postcards, four metallic paints, six paint pens, five markers, a watercolour tray and paintbrush, sixty wriggly eyes and sixty stickers. On the plus side this is a nicely packaged set, which would appeal probably more to boys and it is hard to get art sets for older boys (this is suggested for ages 6+). So, if you do have an arty boy – or indeed girl – with an interest in the Horrible Histories books, then this would be a lovely present. However, although it does have a lot of positives, there are a couple of negatives. Firstly, the pieces do not pack back inside easily, unless your child are careful and keep all the plastic inlays (mine are not that careful!). That is a minor gripe, but I always do prefer toys where you can pack away the pieces so they don’t get lost. Also, I thought it was a shame that were not any colouring sheets. It would have been nice if there had been some posters to colour or if the art pad had had activity/colouring sheets, rather than just plain paper. Overall, though, this is an interesting set with lots to do and will appeal to all lovers of the Horrible Histories – with particular appeal to boys. | paint stick draw // 5.0 // 26 Jun. 2014 // By

TOP 100 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 17 Aug. 2014 // This set contains a good collection of art materials themed around the very popular horrible histories books and tv programmes. There is an Art pad, paint pens, stickers, stencils, metallic paints, marker pens, paintbrush, watercolour tray and wiggly eyes. No complaints from my 8 year old horrible histories fan about the contents of the box. However, I think this set could have been improved if a bit more information/project ideas linked to history had been included to tie the materials together with their theme a bit more strongly. | Packaging // 5.0 // 14 Dec. 2013 // By

 on 14 Dec. 2013 // I really only wanted to leave feedback about the packaging and postage of this item.  This toy is fantastic and it is great value, however it cost me much more due to the completely oversized box it arrived in!  We had to take time off work to drive to the other side of the city to collect it, as this toy was packaged in a box which was approx. 10 times larger than the actual toy box!  Therefore, it was oversized and far too big to fit at the local parcel motel!While I can recommend the toy itself and the great value, I would ask that the sender relook at how they package them up for shipping!! | Happy halfterm fun // 5.0 // 3 Jun. 2014 // By

 on 7 Feb. 2009 // I have got 3 children so I did think these would get some use from them. However, I actually bought them to add some sparkle to my home made computer greetings cards at Christmas.I wasn't expecting them to work as well as the traditional glue on paper, sprinkle glitter, shake off method but they actually worked much better.The easy to hold pen design allows for greater definition and control for the placement of lovely sparkly glitter. They come in some really beautiful colours and once dry (takes about 2 hours or so to be totally dry) can create some stunning effects. The glue starts off raised up on the paper after application but you should find it settles down to near flat so that all that is visible is the glitter.Great product for both adults interested in home crafts and children for play and fun. | Glitter Glue Pens // 2.0 // 15 Jun. 2011 // By

 on 15 Jun. 2011 // Very disappointed as this is a crayola product and was expecting their usual good quality. The pens are more like glue pens rather than glitter glue pens. Apart from 1 or 2 pens the rest didnt not work properly because all the glitter had dried on one side of the tube and only the glue was pumping out. So in the end I cut the tubes and mixed the glitter glue to use it.I would not buy this product again as I saw some cheaper quality ones in sainsbury's today and they seemed to do the job well. | crayola glitter glue // 3.0 // 8 Dec. 2010 // By

 on 8 Dec. 2010 // These glitter glue pens are so much fun to use on cards and pictures. My only problem is that 4 out of the 9 pens only have a centimeter of coloured glitter and the rest is glue. The glitter sits at the bottom and won't mix in with the glue. The other 5 are brilliant to use. | Was expecting easy to use pens for xmas labels // 1.0 // 3 Mar. 2015 // By

 on 14 Oct. 2015 // One thing everybody ought to know before they purchase these is that they are paint markers, NOT felt-tip pens or any variation thereof. As such, they can be purchased at most decently-connected art shops, and are by no means unique to this producer. That said, the price is quite good (regular paint markers can run up to 4.95 GBP each), the colors are strong, and the application easy. I can't really think of any negatives here at all, although the panel-liner is a felt-tip that doesn't have a great deal of precision; I prefer using a 0.02 mechanical pencil. If anybody here hasn't used a paint marker before, all you need to do is shake one firmly until the clear tip turns colored, then apply -lightly- to the surface of your choice. Pressing too hard will only result in splashing the paint, ruining the kind of delicate finish these markers were designed to produce. Soft single strokes that all go in the same direction will result in the best finish, in my experience. | Limited use so far // 3.0 // 7 Jan. 2014 // By
    
    Philip
  
 on 7 Jan. 2014 // I haven't got much use out of these yet. The coloured markers come out quite vibrantly; they are good for covering up gate marks. The tip of the black panel line marker is too thick for precise application. Probably better to just buy one of those 0.02 mm panel line markers if all you want to do is panel lining. | and two pens with the same silver (more like gunmetal actually) is a bit unnecessary // 4.0 // 24 Jan. 2016 // By

 on 9 Oct. 2011 // **Updated 20 October 2012**The first S032G is still going strong, and is so good to fly outdoors occasionaly (in ZERO wind) that I have ordered a second helicopter.  The price has just dipped, so good opportunity to buy a second heli.  This way I should always have spare parts to keep one heli operational; the cost of individual spare parts (blades, batteries, motors) can be far more than the cost of the entire new helicopter.  The S032G has a few glitches (occasional loss of power in flight), but these helis are such good value for the money and can be used outdoors where you can have much more freedom to control them with ease (in zero wind).After the passage of time/more practice, I find the S032G is actually very controllable indoors but is rather too cramped even in a moderate inside area.  For me, this is partially because I avoid flight over objects that might get damaged (or damage it) if it falls out of the air!  I have avoided the larger S031G as I think it will get no use indoors, and outdoors would probably require a trek out to the nearest field.If you like the S032G, seriously consider the S036G - that is a similar size and a very nicely detailed version of the Bell AH-1 Cobra.  Check out my review of that helicopter, it is more expensive, and having a similar radio system is also subject to the occasional loss of power in flight - so operate it wisely.OK these helicopters are not as 'fancy' as a 4 channel helicopter, but what they lack in a fourth channel (sideways movement), they make up for in sheer robustness, value and serviceability.  I can buy a second S032G AND S036G (and just have!) for LESS than than a comparable sized four channel; which by the way will probably get broken as soon as you look at it in a funny way!Read more › | Excellent beginner helicopter - pity about the battery... // 4.0 // 6 Jan. 2011 // By

 on 6 Jan. 2011 // This helicopter is a tonne of fun - period !The only issue is the battery life which is pretty bad.The flight time is around 6 minutes and that feels like its gone in 2 minutes (time really does fly when you are having fun).The package doesn't include any spare blades just the rotor and there is no USB charge cable either, which is a shame.The helicopter is still a great present for your child though and will make him/her want to have a go at the next step in RC heli's or planes. | Very good product but let down with poor radio equipment // 4.0 // 30 Aug. 2011 // By

 on 30 Aug. 2011 // i have had this helicopter for about a year now and it has been great for indoor and outdoor flying, when it isnt windy! it is very easy to fly even for beginners and i was very impressed with its build quality! one thing you must be aware of though is this helicopter uses 27MHz radio equipment, this is very basic and you will have times were interference will disrupt your radio link and the helicopter will just fall out the sky but thankfully this does not happen very often and the good build quality will reduce damage during a crash, overall i would say that this is a good buy for beginners and pros! | SYMA S032 Gyro 3ch Radio Controlled helicopter // 5.0 // 3 Jan. 2011 // By

 on 17 Nov. 2013 // Long ago I bought a kite with two lines, the sort you can do acrobatics with, I then spent two hours watching my kite crash again and again on the ground like a kamikaze aeroplane, each time spending approximately three seconds in the air. Very frustrating. Along comes Brookite Shadow Kite, you do need a minimum of breeze to get it in the air but once it is up there you could almost peg the line in the ground and go away for an ice cream, it will stay up for ages with a very nice long moving tail. The components are basic but sturdy, an adult might be required to correctly decipher the instructions diagrams regarding where to tie the line to the kite but not too difficult. I would definitely recommend to anybody who was interested in taking up kite flying as a hobby, you will be most rewarded. | ABSOLUTE BARGAIN // 5.0 // 5 July 2013 // By
